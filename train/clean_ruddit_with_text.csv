  the difference in average earnings between men and women can be explained by taking into account relevant factors   so it is not a myth  you just feel that you can explain it ,-0.083
the myth is that the  gap  is entirely based on the sex of the person  ,-0.022
the assertion is that women get paid less for the  same  jobs  and that they get paid less  because  they are women  ,-0.146
you said in the op that is not what they are measuring  they are measuring aggregate    as entertainers  women make less  is not that what jlaw was complaining about ,-0.083
 men and women are not payed less for the same job  i don t think many people say this is the case though  i think this is a misconception on the other side  not something feminists have said  even if women have a lower  average  wage in all jobs than men  i mean that is even bigger than individual cases  this shows that women are in an inferior position  more  than if a woman were to get literally 30 cents less  because averages show the bigger picture   edit  changed 70 to 30 ,-0.042
  all the wage gap is  is an average of total men s pay vs total women s pay  if you believe that is all it is  then sure   so you admit it exists    when people refer to the pay gap  that   is what they are referring to most of the time   i d say most of the time people think they are talking about discrimination  which is only true if they actually say it is about discrimination   this is essentially critics that are assuming they are saying something other than what they are saying ,-0.021
no  the point is they aren t talking about discrimination here ,-0.174
so women are paid less for the same job ,-0.229
but obviously that doesn t make sense  does it  that women just don t want to earn more money  that conflicts with what we know about humankind  people  men and women both  generally do want to make money and generally aren t okay with being given less than other people are given  women are a whole aren t just less interested in money than men are  something must be going on ,0.0
i think that hollywood and professional sports are a big exception here  because salaries in those two industries have virtually no cap  and often aren t tied to the quality of work or quantity of work at all   they are about subjective  star power  ,0.098
  i don t think many people say this is the case though  i think this is a misconception on the other side  not something feminists have said   president obama and hilary clinton say this  all  the time   every time they mention the discrepancy in earnings  it is  always   women deserve equal pay for equal work  ,-0.083
i don t think they are any different  they are the truest form of perceived value and scarcity of skill    it s the difference between the wnba and nba    there are many factors that could keep wages low for a woman    for instance  my wife took maternity leave for 6 weeks and her boss would hound her about missing our son or what her future plans were with our son  her boss never asked if i were going to take time off  etc  the supposition was my wife was going to quit  my wife chose not to and after a year her boss finally let up    but if my wife did quit  somehow then that would be used to say women keep wages low themselves ignoring that women are often the go to for child rearing  ,-0.062
  women are a whole aren t just less interested in money than men are   source   mine is only anecdotal  but in my experience  factors  other than money    schedules  flexibility  time off  work condition  work enjoyability  etc    are much more important to women than they are to men ,-0.062
the gist of my post was  does it make sense to you  it conflicts with what we think know of humankind   so no source for that train of thought ,-0.021
biological differences cannot explain the trends we have seen in cs  until about 1985  female enrollment in cs tracked up alongside other technical fields  then it suddenly reversed and dropped dramatically    if the difference is biology  then what is going on here  either there has been a dramatic change in women s biology since 1985 or there has been a dramatic change in cs  but not other technical fields  since 1985 that has not matched women s biology  both of those are really suspect ideas  imo ,-0.083
  it is the difference between the wnba and nba   i m not saying this is not another can of worms entirely  but i have heard that this is primarily because the skill level of the players is not the same  the games are less exciting  and the stakes are lower  that feeds back on itself ,-0.188
 the fact of the matter is  unless you want to strip young women of agency  and force them into high paying fields  and restrict them from having a family  there really is nothing that can be done about this difference in average earnings  mainly  because it is not a problem  there is no discrimination involved   that is not true  there is another way to reduce the differnce  instead of stripping the agency of young women away  you could strip the agency of young men away  you could force them into low paying fields  and force them to take extra time off work whenever a female coworker has a kid ,0.083
well  if your wife quit in order to be a full time mother  doesn t that exactly mean that she chose to make less and therefore bring down the aggregate wage of all women  you have repeated the fact that women are generally the go to for child rearing but i don t see how that is relevant  you are free to quit your job and be a stay at home dad and let your wife continue her career  there is no inherent reason women should continue to be the primary caregivers and i don t see why any parent should be given special consideration by an employer and paid more or offered promotions just because they had kids and chose to spend less effort and time on work  ,-0.104
women have not spent years being told that their value as human beings is tied to the money they bring in  it would honestly surprise me a lot if women cared as much about pay as men do ,0.188
doesn t it also mean the husband choose for his wife to earn less  if a husband and wife want a stay at home parent and decide together in mutual agreement for the wife to quit her job  then the choice for the woman to earn less rests equally on both man and woman in that situation  so we can t just say it is all women making these choices  men contribute to the choices as well ,0.175
so you do believe socialization plays a huge role in people s choices  and you do acknowledge that in the past women were not socialized to be as career focused as men  so it seems to me like you would understand how the explanations of why the wage gap exists are not justifications and that it stems from outdated gender roles conditioning that should be eradicated ,0.0
absolutely  but  socialization  is not a monolith   women are discouraged from lucrative careers  and  men are willing to sacrifice more for their careers because they are judged more harshly on them  both goes under socialization  but they are extremely different explanations  i don t think there is anyone outside a small minority that argues that socialization plays no role at all ,0.042
op is arguing that  or at least that it is not a problem ,-0.354
no  op is arguing that the difference in incomes is not due to discrimination  which is probably not completely true  but mostly true  maybe 1 5th of the difference being discrimination  ,-0.042
maybe it could have something to do with the recent trend of feminists saying computer science is sexist  who would want to join a profession that would treat them as less  even if there is no sexism the perception could keep people away ,0.417
so you agree that its not a biological difference ,-0.417
  is it possible that new developments in particular fields led women away   you tell me  we would need to see a massive shift in the field to explain this  both my parents were software engineers and i am a cs phd  in my opinion  there was no sea change in the 80s in terms of the actual work done by computer scientists and software engineers that justifies a massive change in trends among women in cs    you are right that the stats i gave do not necessarily indicate sexism  but they do indicate that the  men and women are just different  justification is extremely loose  even if women aren t discouraged by intentional sexism  culture can still play a big role  a lot of people feel that these cultural forces are a problem  ,-0.042
there is a culture of exclusion in many higher paying fields like tech and science wherein women don t feel like they belong  are equals  etc  to men  and so some elect to enter another field after experiencing this directly  whereas others opt never to enter such fields in the first place and take up lesser paying jobs    sociological forces are at play  is my point  also  the burden of children is something you should not neglect  there are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life  something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings  and if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women  women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men  on average  because  yes  child care and home making is labor  albeit unpaid  ,-0.109
because it is what commonly happens  there is what can and what is    what is is getting better  but we still have work to do  ,-0.458
but what is the work that needs done exactly  that is i believe the point of contention  if you say we just need to advocate for cultural shifts  i agree  that is hard to do and not really the purview of the government  if you want specific government action  what specifically would that be  another equal pay law is not going to solve anything  ,0.083
 doesn t it also mean the husband choose for his wife to earn less  if a husband and wife want a stay at home parent and decide together in mutual agreement for the wife to quit her job  then the choice for the woman to earn less rests equally on both man and woman in that situation   generally  couples opt for one partner to stay home and care for the kids because daycare is  expensive   for babies  it can be  25 0 year expensive  if you make  40 0 year  that is basically your take home after taxes  so  unless both partners are high wage earners  it usually makes more economic sense for one to stay home  no one wants to work a full time job just to pay for someone else to take care of their child ,0.083
so what do you make of that fact that many other countries have much lower aggregate wage gaps than the u s   do they have  biologically different women    or is it just possible that there are cultural reasons that some countries end up having more or less wage inequality in aggregate than the u s  ,0.292
there would be no reason for feminists to call it sexist unless there was already a difference  it is not they just pick a field at random and start painting signs  ,-0.104
i don t know if i would say it is completely not biological  i don t know enough about the differences in brains  but it is definitely more socialization  i have heard there is some country where the vast majority of cs people are women  i can t remember where ,-0.104
for me is the lack of actual existence  i take the scientific method to heart   there is currently no way to actual prove his existence  therefore god does not exist ,0.104
so anything which you cannot prove the existence of logically does not exist ,-0.125
yeah  i cannot think of anything which cannot be proven through the scientific method in which i believe   what would be your argument to that ,-0.146
sure  god may exist  but there is simply zero evidence for the existence of any supreme being    thus for you to claim that he must exist is a bit far fetched   there is zero evidence for an invisible dragon flying over my computer right now  thus  i can claim that my dragon  based on all evidence  doesn t exist either    ,0.188
can you restate that  i think you are saying the opposite of what you intended ,-0.042
 i cannot think of anything which cannot be proven through the scientific method in which i believe   how would you go about proving that claim  which you apparently believe  through the scientific method   how do you measure belief  how do you show that it is the  i  that is doing the believing and not some other thing  how do you  scientifically  show the existence of the  i  at all  and having crossed those hurdles  how do you determine that each of your beliefs are scientifically provable  is that even possible  most people have an infinite number of beliefs  how can you confirm  scientifically  that each of your infinite beliefs is scientifically provable ,-0.188
there are six arguments that i believe make the existence of god more likely  there are far more  the six are just the most well known     i am not committing the god of the gaps fallacy  i am saying that we have strong deductive arguments for the existence of god  none of the arguments i gave end with  we don t know  therefore god  ,-0.021
do you have any affirmative evidence for god   or is this simply you showing a great deal of conformation bias    if i stripped the bible from existence  would you still believe in the judeo christian god   just saying that these x arguments mean that god is possible doesn t mean that god as you know him does exist  it just means that it is possible   ,0.191
in my post i listed several arguments for the existence of god    the arguments i gave also do not end with  therefore god is possible   they end with variants of  therefore god exists   if you accept the premises then the conclusion necessarily follows  some may not seem as obvious  such as the kalam  but when parsed out leads to a powerful  immaterial  personal cause that exists outside of time and space    the argument for the resurrection uses the bible but i don t assume that the bible is the word of god or even accurate when i use it  i treat it as a historical document and use principals found in bayesian probability theory to make the case for the most likely explanation    ,0.167
  there is currently no way to actual prove his existence  therefore god does not exist   you don t seem to take the scientific method to heart very much ,-0.062
there is a difference between a belief and actual existence  people can believe in purple bunnies  that does not mean they exist   the scientific method talks about setting up an observation  testing it  then concluding the hypothesis being correct or not   everything i know that exists can be proven  now my beliefs are different  and i know not everything i believe in is correct  were not all knowing after all   remove the word believe if it makes it confusing  i know he isnt real because you cannot prove it   ,-0.043
once you make an affirmative claim like you just did  god exists     now you have the small problem of showing evidence for that claim  and you have none    you are starting with a conclusion already in mind and then matching things to meet that conclusion which means that you are swimming in confirmation bias  you are just keeping what you like and getting rid of what doesn t mean your final conclusion    you make any claims that you want  they just are useless without evidence    can t you see that anything you can do to prove my god  i can do to  prove  the the invisible flying dragon i just made up   believe in it all you want  believe deeply  but you haven t proven anything since you don t have any evidence  ,0.25
 we cannot scientifically test the existence of god   is a claim   how do you propose we test it ,0.021
i gave multiple arguments for the existence of god    the question was  is there a reason to believe that god does not exist  ,-0.125
can you put the scientific method itself to this test ,-0.681
arguments of the existence of god is not evidence    you understand this correct   ,-0.043
evidence is used in the premise of a syllogism   all men are mortal   socrates is a man   therefore socrates is mortal   this is not evidence but the evidence for  all men are mortal  and  socrates is a man  would be used to reach the conclusion that  socrates is mortal  ,-0.261
i am not the person you are responding to  that said   in order to have a rational discourse  a few presuppositions have to be made concerning the nature of reality  two that come to mind   reality exists  and our senses are giving us a reliable view of that reality    we employ the information provided by our senses to understand reality and survive in it  the scientific method is just an extention of that  the only way to deny or question it is to start questioning our perception of reality  which makes rational discourse impossible ,-0.146
but a materialistic view as expressed through natural selection can directly bring those senses into question  if reason leads us to natural selection and natural selection leads back to a lack of confidence in our reason then the view self destructs  ,-0.106
 the only way to deny or question it is to start questioning our perception of reality  which makes rational discourse impossible    descartes would disagree   the scientific method is inductive reasoning  and we can rule that out and still be left with deductive reasoning  rational discourse is entirely possible when limited to deduction    in fact  given that there is no non circular argument for induction  one might argue that inductive reasoning is inherently irrational  ,0.022
that is a perfectly valid criticism to make  but i would argue that going that route renders the entire argument meaningless  if you are going to question your ability to perceive reality  then you can t justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality   so while it is reasonable to suspect one s senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate  it is not really meaningful outside of that context  in reality  you rely on your senses to survive  and you employ a form of the scientific method in order to do so ,-0.085
trying to come up with a test that proves the existence of god   good luck with that   ,-0.087
how would an argument directly for the nonexistence of something unfalsifiable even work  why is this something we would expect to see even if we knew for sure there was no god  i can posit countless hypothetical entities defined in such a way that they would be impossible to disprove directly regardless of whether they exist  when talking about god  we can take it as a given that any argument against is going to be a counterargument to an argument for god ,0.021
the easiest by far argument against the existence of god  is the  reverse no true scotsman   since the definition of what who god is  is completely subjective and open  no matter what proof you show  it can be dismissed as  no  i meant a different kind of god  insert a special quality here     even if god himself were to show up personally and do an ama  we could dismiss him her it as  not the actual god  just some kind of absolute cosmic creator  but surely not the creator  ,0.104
alright first we need to define what kind of god you are referring to  if its the omnipotent omniscient god type then there is a very simple reason why it does not exist    we are unable to properly verify omnipotence  thus we are not capable of acknowledging a being as being such  thus god does not exist,0.021
well what is your claim that god exists  and we can put that claim to a test   if you say he can heal x y z  we can set up the experiement where he hast the chance to   if you say he is all seeing  we can set up a test to see if it is true  of course you have to find a way to communicate with him ,0.083
 i define god as the greatest conceivable being   this can actually be proof that that god doesn t exist  i can prove this through the sheer power of numbers  greatest implies a sense of quantity  if we posited any being that we might call god  who took up any infinite amount of space  just for one possible value of  greatest   then i can conceive a larger infinity that that being could fill  thus making that god fall short of that standard  anything that is quantifiable  i can conceive of something larger than what actually exists  just by adding 1 to it   so  if we are arguing that god  i can say that any being will fall short of that because of the nature of infinities and the infinite number of infinities and some infinities being larger than other infinities ,0.042
 there is currently no way to actual prove his existence  therefore god does not exist   this statement shows failure to understand the scientific method  according to the scientific method in order to say  x does not exist  x must be falsified  in order for something to not exist according to science it must be tested and disproved the existence of god cannot be proven or falsified and your statement is non scientific reasoning  it would make more sense to say  therfore i have no reason to believe  or  i m not convinced  but the claim  god does not exist  is a negative truth claim and must be supported with a falsification of the positive version of the claim ,0.292
you said you are capable and willing to defend these arguments so i will start with two simple questions   what reason is there to believe objective moral values exist  i have never had a theist answer this question with anything but an appeal to emotion or popularity  or to ridicule moral relativism in place of it   how can one possibly take a resurrection event as anything but near zero probability in their bayesian analysis without first already arguing that a god exists  therefore miracles can happen  and thus how are you not making a circular argument ,0.104
i thought theists usually argue that infinites can t actually exist       i wonder how that works,-0.167
using the same  i can add 1 to it  argument i can prove infinities exist as well  so just in case ,0.043
no rational atheist argues that they can conclusively prove that there is no god  nor is the onus on them to do so  see fsm  etc    your post itself relies on a strawman   i m not going to try to change your view to a view that practically no one actually holds  ,-0.062
i didn t ask for conclusive proof  notice that the question asked for an argument    a single argument   i did not make a strawman  i claimed that atheism is unable to provide an argument for the claim  god does not exist  ,0.062
man  you are asking some great questions  if you are honestly willing to dialogue with me about this i would be happy to answer anything you bring forward    if you would remind me in a week i would be happy to talk you through these    i honestly appreciate the critique but i am asking the original question sincerely and so i feel i should keep my attention  at least for a short time  on the attempted responses  ,-0.087
atheism does not assert that god doesn t exist  ,-0.109
several problems here   1  i have defined god as the greatest conceivable being   2  are you saying our inability to properly verify the existence of something is an argument against its existence  so if we cannot properly verify that any specific person from a tribe exists that we can therefore conclude that no person from the tribe ever existed  or before the discovery of the neutrino that we could conclude that neutrinos do not exist because we cannot observe them   3  why do humans have this special place in your perspective as the arbiters of all truth  whereby if a human is not able to perceive of something that it therefore does not exist   4  to be omnipotent means the ability to bring about any state of affairs which is logically possible for any one in that situation to bring about ,-0.042
i defined what i meant by god in the original post  if you are claiming that an argument against something is the existence of alternative definitions then i would be interested if you would be willing to actually defend that assertion ,-0.043
honestly  the new atheist definition of atheism as  a lack of belief in god  is completely untenable  philosophers simply don t use it as it leads to absurdities and cannot be wrong  it is always true and can be true along with theism   ,0.062
i will probably forget but if you know how the remind me thing works feel free to tag this comment and we can continue our discussion,-0.5
i am not making a straw man  but i am going to base my argument assuming that atheists make an argument that they don t make    do you know what a straw man argument actually is   ,0.159
that is not a  new atheism  definition  that is literally what the word  atheism  means    and it doesn t matter how untenable you find it  it is literally what the people who disagree with you believe    i get that your job would be a lot easier if your atheists would just believe and defend the simple argument that you want to have  but  for the most part  they just don t   atheists lack a belief in god  that is all  if you want to refute that belief  the onus is on you to prove that there is a god    no appeal to authority about  what most philosophers reject  changes that  ,0.043
we aren t debating psychological states  we are debating truth claims  according to that definition of atheism my left foot is an atheist and my dog is an atheist    that definition is true regardless of whether god exists because it is a psychological state so with that definition both atheism and theism are true   it is utterly useless ,0.042
thats the thing  you defined what you mean by god  its not an agreed upon  intersubjective definition   the idea of god is objectively undefendable  no matter how much proof you show to the contrary  unless we agree what we are looking for   it makes as much sense as trying to prove the existence of beauty  or fairness  you can t prove something fundamentally undefined  and something un provable cannot exist in any maningful way ,0.042
 thats the thing  you defined what you mean by god  its not an agreed upon  intersubjective definition   so if someone else comes up with another definition of science then all definitions of science can no longer be discussed and debated    the idea of god is objectively undefendable  no matter how much proof you show to the contrary  unless we agree what we are looking for   i make the claim that it is more plausible than not that god  according to the definition i gave  exists  i am not debating other people s definitions of god nor am i saying that everyone agrees with my definition ,-0.062
god as a construct is impossible to prove nor disprove since he is considered to not exist in mortal world unless something unexplainable happens  that is a very handy way to keep god image alive and always have people doubting on either side  gods existence is kind of similar in a way  if i said i have a cat next to me right now  you may or may not believe it but in the end it will not impact your current life  discussions around it would if that was a popular subject to talk about or had a following but the fact itself would be just as meaningless as trying to argue if it exists or not  it is quite a stretch from god but it captures the point i wanted to make ,0.125
 science  is an idea and a process  nobody claims that science is a physically existing entity  science does not exist  it happens   as for god  your own definition is   i define god as the greatest conceivable being    the idea of  greatness  is ontologically meaningless  unless you mean sheer size  the same goes for other attributes of god  most good  the ultimate truth  the ultimate prefection  the all knowing being etc   these qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception   so  the question is    does the greatest conceivable being exists   and the answer is obviously  no  because that question is nonsensical   tldr  you can t claim god s existence unless the definition of god is finite and non paradoxical  illogical beings cannot exist ,0.042
  science  is an idea and a process  nobody claims that science is a physically existing entity  science does not exist  it happens   sorry  i think i didn t clarify my objection sufficiently  you said that in order to discuss god we would need a definition that is agreed upon  an  intersubjective definition     i was asking if the same is true of science or if you are going to commit the fallacy of special pleading for science     the idea of  greatness  is ontologically meaningless  unless you mean sheer size  the same goes for other attributes of god  most good  the ultimate truth  the ultimate prefection  the all knowing being etc   philosophy has generally agreed upon certain great making properties  knowledge  eternality  and power to actualize states of affairs are ones that i believe can easily be defended  ,-0.083
i do not think that is accurate  we have several  well  many  arguments for the existence of god  i have given six    i did not ask for proof  i asked for an argument  there is a distinct difference  we cannot prove the multiverse to be false but we can offer arguments for or against it ,-0.062
maybe with some dogs  yeah  but wolves are vastly underrated  they are like lions of the dog world   absolutely powerful and massive  people confuse them for being smallish  the size of medium sized dogs  they are probably bigger than the biggest dog    you would almost definitely end up with a fuck up body at the end of a fight with some of the dogs ,0.271
i think that dogs are more dangerous because they can both bite you and claw you and humans do not have the same abilities as them  as you mentioned  they are also faster so that gives them another bonus against us  finally  dogs do not have the same moral conscience as we do so if a dog is attacking you and you are in a bad situation and cannot fight back  the dog will not acknowledge that and will keep attacking  leaving you with no chance of winning the fight ,0.083

dogs have incredibly sharp teeth set in incredibly strong jaws  if it is a smaller dog  you would probably be fine  but a bigger dog will be stronger and faster than you  even if you are strong and fast  you might be able to win in the end  but you are going to get fuck up in the process   and most people in videos are taken by surprise and are often not young  fit males ,-0.043

you are lumping in very different animals here   have you ever even seen a coyote  they are relatively small  there is a reason they scavenge or hunt in packs  unless you have it backed into a corner  it is just going to run away   wolves  on the other hand  can outweigh a small adult  and do so while having much more speed  strength  and more potent natural weapons   dogs span the whole spectrum of sizes shapes  depending on the breed  i don t think anyone doubt you could dropkick a chihuahua  but what about a mastiff that outweighs you and stands as tall as your chest ,0.042

biggest dogs can be 100  lbs more than big wolves  ,-0.5
wolves are  100lbs  where as some of the largest domesticated dogs are 200    but  that being said  it is a 100lb dog that has been raised in either kill or be killed scenarios  not a 200lb dog that likes your lap ,-0.167
  wolves  on the other hand  can outweigh a small adult  and do so while having much more speed  strength  and more potent natural weapons   wolves can also have really well developed team tactics so there is a solid chance you would not even be dealing with one wolf  ,-0.217
coyotes and wolves are pack hunters so it is unlikely that you would come across just one  dogs  coyotes  and wolves have fangs and claws and you do not  they will always go for the weakest part and then all they have to do is get in one bite and hold on with their super strong jaws and shake  and no matter how speedy you are  they are faster  the only way a large stick could help is if you throw it ,-0.447

i used to feel the same way until i heard wolves while hunting  it was chilling  i ran for like 1 2 a mile out of there,-0.25
i mean  i am not particularly invested here  if you came out with some navy seal copypasta sounding story i likely would not believe you  it is more that i find a lot of people take for granted their ability to handle panic situations well    i ve been in a bunch of them  sometimes i handled it really well  and a few times i broke and just lost my shit   once i just shut down and walked away in a fugue    its a hell of a thing man  and i don t know that i could count on it in that context  ,0.109
i will not argue that a bit  based on history  i think i know how i would react in a similar scenario as the one described above  keyword  think  but it depends on the situation  when faced with a pack of wolves or a bear i would say the odds of me shit ting myself and passing out from fear would be pretty good  then again maybe id turn into superman  then again  maybe a poodle would make me shit  ,0.375

3 5 inches or 2 5 inches doesn t really matter  wolves have teeth and claws and have been designed to kill    we simply would be over matched  ,-0.375
there is no need to exaggerate to make the point  ,-0.417
it really is not that much of an exaggeration    claws and teeth and a massive amount of bite force per square inch means that we would probably lose  more so if we were facing more than one animal  ,-0.106
the world record wolf  killed in alberta  was 230 lbs  that wolf is bigger than you if you are an average american man  it has daggers for teeth  it can run 40 mph  this makes ray lewis look like a baby back bitch   still think you can fight it bare handed  ,0.271
same goes for humans  also  we can climb trees,-0.5
weirdly enough  i think about this fairly frequently  i would not hesitate to use my weak ass mouth to rip out the throat of an animal or human aggressor if my life depended on it  ,0.435
i guess it depends on where you are when attacked  if you are attacked in a building you might have huge advantages  locking doors  getting weapons etc  or somewhere you can climb vertically  just keep kicking it as it tries to climb up or throw items down   on flat ground though without a good weapon the wolf would kill most people  ,0.229
dog or coyote yes  wolf no pack of 3 or more large dogs no pack of 5 or more coyote no  pack of 4 or more wolfs hell no,-0.022
i would seriously fight a bear the one that took out leo in the revenant id smash that mofo,0.062
i believe it is given in the op that this is 1 1  your point is valid  but moot in the given parameters  ,-0.375
they do have more weapons  but they have some significant weaknesses as well  the first thing that comes to mind for dogs is the front legs  they don t bend sideways very well and are pretty thin so you could easily have the strength to break their legs in one swift movement  they also have no way to cover their eyes so they are a very vulnerable target as well  if it was preoccupied biting your leg you could go straight for the eyes and do serious damage  potentially enough to put them out of action immediately   i m not saying these weaknesses would be easy to exploit by any means or guarantee you to win  but thought i would provide a counterpoint to them having more dangerous weapons ,0.125
yes  because you are alive and the wolf is not,-0.362
still not 2 5 inches  1 inch is about as long as their canine teeth get  and the older they are  the shorter the teeth  ,-0.438
he also would not be fighting back and trying to hurt your dog no    people have survived wolf bear coyote you name it attacks many many times  op standing a chance is not anywhere near out of the realm of possibility,-0.146
the problem is that wolfs generally hunt in packs so even if you got one down the other would team up on you,-0.542
  and most people in videos are taken by surprise and are often not young  fit males   because these animals go for easy targets and a young fit male is not an easy target  even if they win  chances are they will considering it is normally many vs 1   if they get injured they can easily die ,0.167
what is more flexible in wolves though  is their spine and neck  these guys easily lick their own buttholes  you get a good grip on its leg and think you have the upper  hand  but suddenly your fingers no longer exist and there goes basically any advantage you had ,0.196
sorry op  your thread has been removed per submission rule e  please reply to some top level comments and message the moderator mail to have your thread approved ,-0.271
yes but in those cases  the animal decided it was not worth the effort to kill the survivor  most wolves bears wild animals will run away from humans so long as they aren t totally surprised and feel cornered   in the scenario op put forth  a fight to the death between a wolf and a human would go very badly for op ,0.229
i hope i can change your view  a far more effective way to make sure that flights are safe and comfortable for everyone would be to ban insane bigots only  this would have double benefits of course  besides banning the very worst fundamentalists of any religion  it would also ensure that i don t run the risk of sitting next to you while being type anything on the fitzpatrick scale ,0.021
an airline offering muslim free trips would instantly draw the attention of national news outlets  the news would shortly go international about 50 times faster than that chinese detergent ad  any muslim extremists interested in bombing or hijacking a plane would make one of those flights their next target  as it would be a direct affront to their religion    it would not be too hard for a terrorist organization to recruit a muslim without a social media presence that makes their religion obvious  and have them pay for the flight with a credit card registered under a white sounding name    regardless of all of the issues associated with racism and intolerance  i also can t think of a better way for an airline to make themselves a target for an attack ,0.312
your idea  while posing a real problem with ethics  will not work as     it provokes the terrorists who will make the effort of taking down a plane against this method just to show that you can t hideux anywhere      it will encourage a part of the people you ban to join the terrorists  there is a handful number of people who are in the hesitating and doubting phase about sharing isis s view  banning muslims and people with certain names will only show weakness from democracies  and only confirm isis s ideas about occident    ,0.426
i mean  you probably think that should be repealed too  but you realise this is a flagrant violation of the civil rights act  do you think it should be open season on minorities  or just muslims  then again  since you mention euros  i don t know where you are from  but certainly it is somewhere with similar anti discrimination legislation ,0.146
 it would not be too hard for a terrorist organization to recruit a muslim without a social media presence that makes their religion obvious  and have them pay for the flight with a credit card registered under a white sounding name    for those kind of flights you would need more than just a credit card  the background checking would exhaust most possibilities  ,0.128
 it will encourage a part of the people you ban to join the terrorists   do people who want to bring guns with them for genuine reasons plan a terrorist attack because they will not let them  only islam has this problem  that is why i want to ban them     only show weakness from democracies  the only weakness we have is that every time we have a terrorist attack we just condemn it  express your best wishes  and claim that not all muslims are terrorists  political correctness is what got us in this situation  ,0.479
there are relatively simple ways around all of the provisions you are talking about  it doesn t matter what security you put in place  it can be bypassed relatively simply  especially by terrorist organizations dedicated solely to doing things just like that  respond to the meat of my post  how is this airline not painting a bright red bullseye on their planes  and more importantly  how would anyone feel safer taking these flights knowing that there is no airline muslim terrorists are more dedicated to terrorizing than the one you are flying with ,0.146
 but you realise this is a flagrant violation of the civil rights act    i am not familiar with american law  i m not american  but aren t you able to deny service to anyone based on whatever you want  are having separate bathrooms for boys and girls a civil act violation too    do you think it should be open season on minorities  or just muslims   most minorities are absolutely normal  it is only muslims that are problematic  ,0.229
 how is this airline not painting a bright red bullseye on their planes    just like banning guns or explosives was not a bullseye to provoke    ,0.271
  every time we have a terrorist attack we just condemn it   where did you get that idea  both the us and europe passed rather privacy invasive anti terrorism legislation  it is just that combatting terrorism effectively is hard  it is especially hard because of ethical objections  but let s not pretend that objecting to terrorism or religious discrimination is political correctness  ,0.213
 the background checking would exhaust most possibilities   exhaustive background checks take weeks and cost hundreds of dollars  how would you accomplish this with the additional 25 euros you proposed per person  currently  more than 75  of all airline tickets are purchased less than a month before the flight  how would a person book a flight less than a month in advance  ,-0.271
 exhaustive background checks take weeks and cost hundreds of dollars  how would you accomplish this with the additional 25 euros you proposed per person   the exhaustiveness of the background check would depend on how many money you put  wealthier clients would have safer rides  25 euros was just a number  it could be anything     how would a person book a flight less than a month in advance   if you care about safety  order before    ,-0.167

banning guns and explosives doesn t make a statement about any particular religion or ethnicity  the only people who could possibly be so offended as to specifically target an airport for doing so are the most insane of gun nuts   also  banning guns and explosives is federal policy affecting all airports  airlines  flights  and customers  so targeting specific airports or flights in retaliation would not make any sense anyway  whereas your solution would make for a very obvious target ,0.188
the guy said he would rather  pay 25 euros more to assure that my flight has no potential terrorists  muslims  on it  which implies that he is european and that american law does not apply to him ,0.062
true  but his question here was    i am not familiar with american law  i m not american  but aren t you able to deny service to anyone based on whatever you want    in which case my answer is relevant  while i am not familiar with european law  i would assume that similar protections exist as well ,-0.083
 banning guns and explosives doesn t make a statement about any particular religion or ethnicity   i care more about safety than the possibility of hurting the feelings of someone     also  banning guns and explosives is a federal policy affecting all airports  airlines  flights  and customers  so targeting specific airports or flights in retaliation would not make any sense anyway   yes  the target would be the planes that now forbid guns  as in during the transition from legal to illegal     whereas your solution would make for a very obvious target   that s why we have the safety checks  ,0.292
the terrorist attacks of 9 11 were attacks done by a small enemy who evaluated the weaknesses of a much stronger opponent and found a vulnerability to exploit  this involved years of planning  training and execution  it is overly simplistic to think that our vulnerability lies in a repeat attack  we have effectively closed that door    our greatest vulnerability lies  like it was on 9 11  with something we can t predict and a weakness we are unaware of  banning muslims from flights only increases the strength of extremest propaganda and the number of enemies they can recruit  your idea would result in a world full of more terrorism and violence not less an ultimately making us all less safe  ,0.213
 our greatest vulnerability lies  like it was on 9 11  with something we can t predict and a weakness we are unaware of    correct  but there are measures  like banning guns from luggage  that help  even if they are not perfect  banning muslims is the same     banning muslims from flights only increases the strength of extremest propaganda and the number of enemies they can recruit    more reasons to ban muslims  sorry  but the problem is them being terrorists  not us defending ourselves from potential terrorists     your idea would result in a world full of more terrorism and violence not less an ultimately making us all less safe   the solution is to weaken terrorists organizations  not stop defending ourselves from them  ,0.354
but you are not weakening them with the ban  you are strengthening them by validating their persecution narrative  if your house is on fire you have a choice  use a water to douse the fire or try to protect yourself by throwing logs at the flames  we don t get safer by adding fuel to the fire    ,-0.255
airlines are private companies meaning they can do as they please  they just care about profits   for the sole purpose that airlines would not financially benefit from this  they should not do it   just the negative backlash would cost them more than they could profit  there is hardly any shortages in people that need to fly   ,0.043
  i care more about safety than the possibility of hurting the feelings of someone   you must be a big fan of the nsa spying on american citizens without a warrant ,0.062
i think they should be allowed to do that  but i don t think it would make good business sense  while there are undoubtedly many like yourself who would pay the premium  the money they would lose in boycotts  terrible press  and lawsuits would be a net loss for the company  there is no way they stand to make money by taking such a polarizing position   if they could  i imagine airlines would have already started something less controversial  like adults only flights ,0.064
not really  since in muslim flights they would kill mostly muslims  it would help since these segregated flights help cool off the tensions between the religions and cultures  if a 100 europeans die  europeans would be angrier at muslims than if a 100 muslims die    sometimes separations are the right thing  chehzs and slovaks are in a good relationship since czechoslovakia got divided    ,0.25
are you saying people who pay more and buy tickets earlier will get put on separate   safer  flights  that would not be a very viable business scheme  they would have to pay much  much more  but if they get put on the same flight as people who pay less and buy their tickets later  that would just be a big old scam ,-0.021
a less exhaustive background check would risk accepting muslims on the flight  which would completely defeat the whole point of a muslim free flight ,0.208
in islam it is a greater sin to kill fellow believers than  infidels   by having segregated flights you would be providing terrorists with ideal targets  ,0.125

because it is even safer to be in a plane with no muslims  less potential terrorists is more safety  ,0.292

why not ban men from airplanes  why not ban military aged people from airplanes  if we are going to ban people from flight based on demographics why not use these two since they are better predictors of violence than religion  they are also much easier to check and verify   restrict flight to only white women  this would make them very safe  what could go wrong with that ,0.25
you phrased the title wrong  then   airline companies should provide muslim free plane rides  implies that there is some financial incentive for airline companies to do this  generally  firms care about profits rather than altruism  ,0.042
correct but it is semantics  in the argument and most replies it comes off as obvious  i state it many times  ,-0.25
 why not ban men from airplanes  why not ban military aged people from airplanes   muslims are the extremists  not men or military aged people     f we are going to ban people from flight based on demographics why not use these two since they are better predictors of violence than religion    in this case religion is better    restrict flight to only white women  this would make them very safe  what could go wrong with that   if they want to ,0.375

  muslims are the extremists  not men or military aged people    so you have no problem labeling the 1 6 billion people that follow islam as being extremists  but when it comes to labeling the 3 billion people that are male as violent that s just a bridge to far   refusing service to men because of the remote possibility that they may become violent is stupid  you agree it is stupid  but when talking about the even more remote possibility that someone who is identifiable as muslim may become violent that s a real threat ,0.562
 so you have no problem labeling the 1 6 billion people that follow islam as being extremists  but when it comes to labeling the 3 billion people that are male as violent that s just a bridge to far   for me yes but i guess if you wanted you could have a female only flight  statistically it would be safer than a male flight   ,0.128
prostitution is usually prohibited because of reasons unrelated to prostitution itself  e g the country s economy  the  2 consenting adults  is not always the case  instead  poor girls become prostitutes because they don t have any other real choice  so  yes  if you live in a country in which there is the educational  economical and societal advancement necessary to guarantee that the majority of times prostitutes will be prostitutes by choice  sure  but that is not the reality in many places  ,0.229
but the poor girl who would turn to prostitution out of desperation is not helped by making prostitution illegal  in fact she is hurt by it because now she has even less options ,0.178
i don t know  i think the majority of the country would rather do anything  including go hungry or commit other crimes  rather than become a prostitute   the issue is that we don t want government aid to be contingent on selling your body  lost your job  need snap  i am sorry  why haven t you accepted this excellent  well paying career opportunity with the love hotel  ,0.146
then add a clause that makes it so people don t have to accept prostitution positions to get benefits  making it illegal just to accomplish that is ridiculous ,0.271
that is true in practice in many cases too  unfortunately  however  i was talking about what was the idea behind the law  funnily enough the reason that the law fails to  protect  those girls is the same reason prostitution is prohibited  the lack of general socioeconomical advancement   the thing is it is believed that making prostitution legal would make the problem even worse  even if it still is a problem with it prohibited   ,0.083

not really  think about it practically    1 prostitutes would be significantly less likely to marry and have kids and having kids is important for our society  low birth rates and unstable marriages are bad for our society  most men would not marry prostitutes   2 prostitution is correlated with drug use and psychological problems  one could make an argument that prostitution could make unstable people even more unstable since only a tiny minority of prostitutes like what they are doing and most are into it for the money ,0.213
  1 prostitutes would be significantly less likely to marry and have kids and having kids is important for our society  low birth rates and unstable marriages are bad for our society  most men would not marry prostitutes   by that rationale  we should also outlaw bars and alcohol because they also facilitate extra marital sex  how about also setting a curfew and a bed time for everyone in america and getting rid of all the filth in music and on television   it is not the business of the governments to try to outlaw things that don t facilitate marriage  american adults get to choose what kind of sex life they wish to have with other wiling adults  no one wants a church government     prostitution is correlated with drug use and psychological problems   not legal prostitution  we have seen a safe and effective model working in nevada for generations  ,0.396

the criminality surrounding prostitution is the problem  having sex is good  wasting your money is okay  extortion and social problems are tolerable  but everything else surrounding it is terrible  even the poster children of  legal  prostitution have serious issues with it   loads of things are banned because they are a net detriment  i could handle an an 94 just fine  but chuckle fuck across the road would accidentally shoot his kids and then pick a fight with the cops  and that is  more or less  why assault rifles are banned in canada   on an unrelated note  the an 94 is a fascinating weapon  look it up   ps  the human trafficking thing is bogus ,0.5

there is a difference between legal  and  not illegal   you should want prostitution to be not illegal  legal implies that the state is allowing  or regulating it in some way  it is none of the state s business  any justice system should be concerned with assault  theft  and fraud and making the victim whole  so long as none of these are the case  the state should not be involved in any way ,0.021

that sounds like your opinion  not an argument  why should not the state be involved ,-0.229
i like having sex with men and i occasionally hook up with a guy  for free  of course  if i could charge men to have sex  i would gladly do it  i would have sex more often  and i would make a lot more money than my day job  so from my perspective  prostitution is illegal because men expect their sex to be free  allowing us to charge for sex would allow women to have a lot more financial power over men  patriarchy will not allow that ,0.261
yup  muh patriarchy  totally not because of human trafficking   morality   or any of the other reasons mentioned  it is totally to keep womyn down  except that men can be prostitutes too ,0.25

the issue i have with it  and what i think is at the root of a lot of societies aversion to it  is that incestuous relations are ripe for abuse and coercion to take place   even when the actors are legal adults  similar to how teacher student relationships  while not always illegal  are largely prohibited because of the issue of power dynamics    does that mean that there aren t any cases where incest would be healthy  no  but i think that the risk of unhealthy  coercion and abuse in normalizing incest  generally  outweighs the gains   since it is not like you don t have other options for partners outside of your family  ,0.167

coerced sex is already a crime  if the parent tried to use their position to pressure their child into sex that would be illegal as that is not consensual sex under current legislation  it is the same as an employer saying  if you want this job you have to have sex with me  which is also illegal  in the example of the parent child relationship  the child could testify that they were pressured into sex and therefore did not consent and the parent would go to prison   in a separate instance where a parent and child chose to have consensual sex with each other  what gives a third party the right to say that  simply because one was a child of the other  that act was automatically not consensual  ,0.25

so i can get an understanding of your view a little further   what kind of incestuous relationships are you okay with  just brother sister  father daughter  mother son ,0.25
if you believe in moral relativism  rather than proscribed morality from religion  anything that a culture finds acceptable is moral and anything it finds unacceptable is immoral  and of course this is dynamic and changes with time  this means there is no universal morality  but there are a some actions that are considered immoral across most cultures  past and present  murder  theft  and incest are the most frequent  i think this makes a case for incest to be considered immoral  and if legislation is based on morality  obviously up for debate whether it should be  then incest would be criminal ,-0.021
having said that  i don t think it should be criminal  when scotus ruled in favor of homo sex ual marriage  i had this same idea  a minority of people would benefit from the right  historically and even currently it is considered immoral  detractors argue about how children will be negatively affected if raised by a couple in one of these relationships  note  i am not saying that incest and gay marriage are or should be considered in the same way  it is just food for thought ,0.083

your predicted  epidemic  is highly unrealistic  regardless of whether it is legal or not  most people do not want to engage in incest  and most of those that do want to avoid having babies with each other for exactly this reason   there are plenty of places where adult incest is legal that are not experiencing any such epidemic ,0.149
your comment on the nazis is drawing a false moral equivalence between ideology fueled eugenics and not wanting more kids to be born with rare genetic disorders  i think that genetic testing and discouraging two people with recessive disorders from breeding would be a good thing  and not at all comparable to nazi beliefs if racial purity and superiority    that being said  if siblings wanted to have a baby  it should be required that they take blood samples to ,0.271

my main concern would be that in some situations  the family could possibly groom a child towards incestuous relationships  if a parent conditions a child to believe that the parent is their future lover  is that healthy  or that a child should be with their sibling  while you could outlaw this practise  it seems like something that would be difficult to get at  and i would rather have the incest banned in general than risk such situations from happening    that said  there is always prosecutorial discretion  if it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there is been no grooming or anything like that  a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges  a bit like how jaywalking is technically a crime in many places  but people are never charged with it unless they actually do something dangerous  ,0.375

there is a famous experiment dealing with relations and human behaviors  if one blood cell in your body was dyed green  but had all the same functionality  it would eventually reproduce and become at least 50  of the bloodstream over many generations  though statistically  it should reproduce at the same rate as all normal red cells  it still ends up dominating half the bloodstream   the same goes for population growth  evolution  etc  countries that legalize incest  i ll use spain as an example  have among the highest rates of reported genetic mutations  we haven t had enough time to see it is full result  i am talking about over 10 generations at least  ,0.167

do you have sources stating the don t reap the economical benefits ,-0.396
  it is a fiscally irresponsible use of limited local and state funds   is it  typically a team generates revenue for the local economy  lets say it costs 1b to build a stadium  but it generates 3 4b over the next few years  how would that be irresponsible     if the government stops contributing to sports stadium financing  owners will still build these stadiums  well are you sure  typically another city just offers a better deal to get them ,-0.292
for purposes of this post  i am making the assumption that no cities or political subdivisions are permitted to pledge funds for new stadiums  my overall point is that an owner may still build a stadium without public funding  so why should a city or state be  forced  into coughing up hundreds of millions or face the team leaving ,-0.292
okay counter argument  when is a city forced   its typically cities fighting over each other for rights  no city is ever forced  they have to get city council and voter approval  i live in the bay area and my city was one of the possible locations for the 49ers levis stadium  but our city voted no   meanwhile there was 5 6 other cities fighting to bring the team over ,-0.021
here in minneapolis  all of the money allocated to revamp our entire light rail system ended up going to the stadium that is falling apart already ,-0.152
you are being naive if you think that you can realistically ban cities from paying sports teams   you will just change it to cities bribing the teams with infrastructure  zoning changes  and possibly good old fashioned corruption instead   there is also another downside that you are forgetting  the city wants the stadium to be in the middle of the city because it have positive knock on effect to the city  the owner wants it to be where the land is cheap in the outskirts ,-0.174
look at san diego   the city was still paying off the latest round of improvements the team extorted them into playing when they started threatening to leave if they did not get a new stadium downtown   the city then wasted millions on planning trying to figure out how to pay for the stadium   in the end spanoa admitted it is all to puff up the value of the team so he can sell it soon  he was going where ever a city was willing to pay for his stadium  now a new city is on the hook ,0.0
if cities fight over who gets the team yet they supposedly lose money from the deal  then something is off in the way they gathered the stats  if i had to guess what is not included    having a good team promotes growth and competition in the city  raising the value of real estate and attracting more wealthy people  this can include successful tech companies  essentially stadiums are loss leaders like  5 costco rotisserie chicken   ,0.043
they have choice you are right  i think we are seeing a bit more hesitation now as we have seen the duration of arena s in the 21st century  30 years is ancient   so we have had time to see the economic impacts and that kind of cash has to have some to the average citizen  going to a game is a choice too  burdening the tax payer is tough  however  i often think they should help subsidize arenas  i think the math needs some honest evaluation in these cases ,-0.083

i have to agree with you  this is a topic that has bothered me for a long time  i have read some of the responses and it still doesn t change my opinion  how can it be justified that taxpayer funds are used to build and maintain stadiums and the taxpayers are still charged like 50 bucks for admission  depending of the sport and stadium  tax payer money goes to building public parks and such  yet we are able to access those for free  right  there are a lot of things that bother me in terms of taxation  how tax dollars are used  and in turn how we have to pay for things that tax dollars already go to support  it really angers me  ,-0.146

  tax payer money goes to building public parks and such  yet we are able to access those for free  right    not really  roads have tolls  hospitals still bill you  public parks often have admission fees   ,-0.083
some roads have tolls  the vast majority don t  and hospitals are a bad example because they are such a complicated mess with where money goes  comes in from  pricing  etc    i haven t seen a single local public park in my area that charges money  the exception are some state parks and that is only for parking  ,-0.208
if sports teams allegedly don t bring any value to a city why is threatening to move to another city forcing cities into it    if a homeless person threathened to leave if they don t get paid  no one would say that person was forcing the city to pay them  they would just let them leave  obviously that is stupid extreme analogy but it kinda gets my point across ,0.229
because politicians need to get re elected  as a result their incentive is to maximize short term gain  and avoid sharp pains  they don t have incentives to optimize for results that will be felt 10 or 20 years from now  therefore we need laws that prevent these conflicts of incentive whenever possible ,-0.146
you can point fingers at either the owners or the local government  but at the end of the day  if an obviously beneficial deal cannot be reached  i don t want my politicians spending my money if they cannot even justify it ,-0.021
there is not much really keeping a sports team in a specific city  so if one city decides not to give incentive  they will just move to the next city that does  the cities are eager to keep them around for the tourist exposure as well as the pride bragging rights  if there is an overall net gain or not  i would be curious for links to some studies    conceptually  i totally agree  especially when it is at the expense of public parks  but sadly it will not mean anything unless everyone agrees not to give incentives ,-0.391
where did i say they bring no value  sure they bring in money but it can take decades to recoup those costs while the private companies are the ones raking in the profits  ,-0.128
your original proposition that the team brings in enough revenue to make the investment worthwhile implies that the owners have the upper hand in negotiations   assuming you are correct about a given stadium   team deal with the city and that it is profitable for the city  then that profit can be held hostage ,-0.354

would you agree that things like libraries and museums should be funded with public money  even if they produce no economic benefit  that is easily calculated  you can argue that furthering the arts in the long term economically benefits us all   i will not contend that more often than not taxpayer dollars should not go to stadiums  but i challenge the word never  if it is determined that it would benefit the people who the government represents more than any other project  this is a hypothetical  then i contend that in those cases it is in the public s interest to do so ,-0.043
the city that the stadium is in will earn way more money or time than the amount they put in it  look at cleveland and lebron  it was estimated that the city lost 100s of millions with him being gone  there is a lot more money to be had for a city shen there is a sports team there  ,-0.188
i would rather see a percentage of stocks go to each household that had their taxes contributed to the stadium or some other structure that allows the people to benefit financially over time ,-0.458
counterpoint   the taxpayer should completely and totally fund the construction of new sports stadiums   but  they should build them as multi purpose amphitheaters that can also serve other needs and retain 100  ownership  and charge a premium for use by sports teams who can afford it   these large projects are the perfect opportunity for a state to obtain regular revenue while providing desirable public services  but it requires that the state  be  the owner ,-0.083
they just had a huge fight over it in calgary  alberta  canada  hockey team wanted the city to cough up  500 million dollars to help build a new stadium  but the mayor told them to take a piss  province is in the middle of an economic downturn  making it a hot button issue in the the municipal election  ,0.0
the thing is  though  that the team will move to an area where the locality will pay  plus  it looks really bad on a cities part if they can t support a professional sports team  if a company is looking to build a new hq  a city can be overlooked because they don t have the ability to support a pro sports franchise ,-0.125
i would suggest that its fine if localities help fund them  but if the team wishes that to happen they should give the city a stake in the franchise  that way costs are mitigated by the profit  ,-0.208
i mean  you are free to vote for politicians who think this way  but other tax payers who want those stadiums and who believe they are beneficial are free to elect officials who want to bid to bring stadiums and sports teams  that is kind of how democracy works  i would ask what the justification is for an outright ban on public money being spent on stadiums  that is pretty ridiculous ,-0.022
any reason these things couldn t have a structured recuperation of the initial investment for the taxpayers ,-0.333
the one argument in favor for taxpayer support for a new stadium  if building the stadium will return economic advantage to the same area in excess of the taxation required  through tourism  jobs  increased property values etc   in addition  if this criteria is met  sometimes cities or states have to competitively support an owner in order for the owner to chose one location over another  ,-0.417

you said that taxpayers should never have to pay for sports stadiums  so i guess all one has to do is show one example where it was beneficial  i would like to draw your attention to the 2010 olympic games in my home city  vancouver  by 2014 the vancouver olympic comittee paid off their debts  and the infastructure built for the olympics is still kept in good shape  a good example is the richmond oval  which is still used for a ton of events ,-0.167

though i wholeheartedly agree with you  my view on this  albeit incredibly simplified  is that due to capitalism  if you city wants a pro team to move in because it will increase revenues and tourism  then you will offer to the organization s owner to pay for a portion of the arena  in the end  the highest bidder gets the team  i know its likely more complex than this but it boils down to capitalism  and that is kinda where i stop caring ,-0.085

  it appears to me that we have gotten to a point where liberals and conservatives hate each other with such passion  that those who disagree with us are seen as the enemy   liberals don t hate conservatives  there are lots of conservatives that are normal people who just have differing views on some subjects  these are people who are willing to come to a middle ground and work things out   now  replace  conservative  with  donald trump supporter  and you are closer to the mark  but not all conservatives support trump  just the ones that deserve pity ,0.083

 moving forward  towards what  perhaps the reason that politics is so polarized is that the issues we are discussing are unable to be compromised without similarly compromising our principles  for instance  there can be no compromise between myself and my politics and the alt right  they are incompatible  ,-0.042
historically  this has been the case  it is unfortunate  but it is just the nature of politics  as well as human nature    however  i think that there is very little  if any  real hatred in politics  the issue is that the social problems at hand are so complex and debatable  they are to sell with just objective data  for any data set i give you in the affirmative  there are several that can refute it  that leaves no other option but to push agendas by painting the  other side  in a negative way   that said  it is a problem when personal attacks become front and center in political discourse  all we can do as a people is see through these games  and focus on the facts  difficult as it may be ,0.042

this is not a matter of  disagreement     people who explicitly attack your way of life and want to restrict how you live it literally  are  your enemies  there is no other way to view it    the difference today is that in the past people didn t hear these messages stated out in the open so widely as they do now   therefore we didn t realize how many of our neighbors actually  were  our enemies  in fact  i would say that this openness helps in the long run   in absolute numbers  there really are fewer such people today than in the past  because people talk about it openly  racism and sexism are  in the arrow of history  still declining over time  we just hear about it more now ,0.146

they are the enemy  we are engaged in a cold war to steer this nation toward what we respectively want it to be  we want greatness and hope  they want exclusion and security above all other considerations  there is no way to put this aside  any attempt to do so would be a falsehood  i am not going to weaken myself just to play nice with ignorant bigots  frankly can t wait for them to die off  sorry  was i supposed to be reconsiliatory in this thread  forget it ,0.404
taxpayers  in a round about way  are investors  if your government is fair and democratic  80  of the time tax payer money benefits the masses  if not a medium size group   if an organization can prove that a new stadium has a positive effect on the local economy   restaurants hotels etc  then i think it is a good investment from the public standpoint  long term,-0.25
the biggest problem with american politics is that our politicians are all bought   government is the entertainment division of the military industrial complex   what this means is that the  liberals vs conservatives  stuff is a farce  it is a show they put on to make us think our opinions matter when all that really matters is money ,-0.104

i am not religious  but fail to see the purpose of this initiative  this is not really is not going to have any meaningful sort of tax revenue impact  because  most  churches don t make a ton of money   and the result of the initiative is really going to be just the closing down of a ton of small churches  most of these churches   in my experience   provide assistance to the homeless  donate time to the community  and provide guidance to a lot of at risk youth  etc    i fail to understand what good your initiative will drive   can you explain  ,-0.104
advancement of religion can include such activities as hosting aa meetings  these are nominally religious  as they invoke a  higher power   and are charitable  provide a service   and advance some notion of religion ,-0.188
religion is protected by the first amendment in the same way that gun ownership is protected by the second    taxing religious institutions doesn t infringe on my right to practice religion any more than taxing the sale of firearms infringes on my right to own a gun   this analogy is inaccurate  a better analogy would be that taxing the operation costs of religious institutions would be similar to taxing the ownership of a firearm on an annual basis  so as to disincentivize ownership  or religious activity  by adding an additional layer of financial obligation ,0.043
if religious institutions were taxed  you would start seeing lobbyists from them trying to get legislation passed in their favor on subjects  if you think big businesses  the nra and such are bad  imagine what the impact churches constantly lobbying and donating extreme amounts of money to political campaigns would be ,0.042
i suppose it is more about the principal of the thing  i don t want my tax dollars effectively subsidizing the spread of religion  by making churches tax exempt  there is tax revenue  and therefore my taxes are higher  even if it is only an extra penny     i don t deny that churches can do good but if all their money goes towards providing assistance to the homeless and such then they will be able to maintain their tax exempt status without needing a spread of religion clause  ,0.25
i get the principle angle  but is principle really worth closing down  potentially  hundreds and maybe thousands of churches across the nation that are working on a shoestring budget right now  again  communities will suffer as a result of this   the only time i really volunteered at homeless shelters  sadly  is when i was a kid and went to church regularly with my parents  i think my story is not uncommon  either    i m just challenging you to consider all the negative consequence you are going to drive as a result of personal principle   ,0.062
to be honest  fostering national or international amateur sports competition seemed a bit odd to me as well  perhaps that should be re evaluated as well  but that seems kinda tangential to this cmv    in order to qualify for 501c3 classification on the basis of education  the institution must  provide instruction or train individuals to improve their capabilities  or provide public education on items that are beneficial to the community   i would welcome churches to submit their requests for that status  but i don t think they would qualify  ,-0.229
a feed the homeless charity organization exists to feed the homeless  but might incidentally end up promoting some local grocery store who agreed to provide the food which is delivered in boxes with the stores logo on them  the feed the homeless organization would still be tax exempt because it is operated for the exempt purpose and the non exempt effect is simple incidental    i fully support programs for addicts remaining tax exempt  they are welcome to argue that any spread of religion is incidental  if they make a compelling argument  great  if they fail  then perhaps they need to rework their program to not include religion  it is not like the 12 steps were particularly effective anyway ,-0.271
if churches had to pay taxes there is no way they would have the money to donate extreme amounts to political campaigns  even if they did  i think that legally it still makes more sense allow religious organizations to play by the same rules as everyone else than make special exceptions for them,-0.022
i firmly disagree  a cost is a cost  it doesn t matter if it is up front or spread out  doesn t make a huge difference  in fact  it is easier for most people organizations to pay a cost spread out over than all up front  regardless  gun ownership does have a recurring cost in license renewal    the analogy doesn t need to be 100  the same  i see no significant differences    another analogy that might suit you better is that in order to assemble in protest you need a permit  and in many places that comes with a non refundable application fee  here is an example of the government actively putting a paywall in front of exercising a first amendment right ,0.0
yes  but the government is specifically supposed to stay out religious matters  actively subsidizing religion violates the principles of separation of church an state ,-0.043
any entity which has  a shoestring budget  is not going to owe much in taxes  that is how a progressive tax system works  the ones that would owe a lot of tax money are the ones that could afford to pay it  there are plenty  and the difference is just like that between wal mart and your favorite mom   pop store  frankly  taxing huge churches would ever so slightly level their playing field with smaller churches  and given that the smaller ones are  proportionately  doing more charitable work  they would be even less likely to be harmed by this change ,-0.083
free speech doesn t mean  0 speech haha  let s say i wanted to get paid to give a debate about healthcare  i still pay taxes on that  ,-0.375
the problem with the churches losing their tax exempt status is not with them having to pay taxes but people who donate being unable to claim that as a tax write off  they will make a lot less money up front this way because less people will domate in the first place  especially smaller churches in poorer areas ,0.062
companies only pay taxes on profit  most religious institutions operate on very threadbare revenue  that they would rarely turn a profit    plus  any excess cash they have would probably be put in to charity work  or salaries  or construction    my point is that even if we removed the  tax exemption  status of churches  they would not turn a profit to be able to tax    the whole proposed change would just cause thousands of headaches and not achieve the goals that you want    yes  maybe some outlying mega churches would be taxed  but that should be handled within the confines of current law and be called out for being ridiculous  but don t throw the baby out with the bath water  ,0.042
since when do companies only pay tax on profit  we tax on revenue and other things as well  i think you have some pretty misguided ideas ,0.021
the power to tax something is the power to destroy it  just as religion should not have control over government  government should not control religion ,-0.213
the power to excessively tax something may be the power to destory it  but taxing religion at the same rate everything else is taxed is only fair  by saying  organization x doesn t have to pay taxes  that tax burden gets shifted to other tax payers  tax payers should not subsidise religion  ,-0.021
the first amendment is a lot clearer than the second  ,-0.312
the church is taxed  not the people going to it  the analogy would be more accurate if it said the firearm manufacturers being taxed  which they are ,-0.042
freedom of press is also protected by the first amendment  and yet we tax the new york times  ,-0.188
besides what  u spoko said  churches can still apply for tax exempt status as charitable organizations if they meet the standards for charitable organizations  they should not be granted tax exempt status by default though  ,-0.125
it is not a first amendment thing  it is a 501c non profit thing  non profit organizations do not get taxed and religious institutions fall under this  should foundations such as make a wish or st  jude s be taxed as well  they exist to help people not make a profit  even though there are establishments that a case could be made against   ,-0.104
it is not enough for an organization to simply say it is not for profit  an organization needs to qualify under certain categories  i object to the spread of religion being a valid category  ,-0.062
the biggest defense of religious institutions being tax exempt is that these institutions function very similarly to a government in many cases  the most prominent example would be healthcare  often times  church communities pool together money to help fund medical operations  they also often run food drives and other fundraisers  in order to benefit their community  taxes often contributes to the same goals of social welfare  so why should they be taxed to contribute to these things  especially in addition to the taxes that the individuals in the church are already paying  ,-0.083
if a religious organization can prove that it is primary goals align with some of the other approved purposes  then they should be granted tax exempt status  i merely object to the spread of religion being a tax exempt purpose in and of itself  ,-0.109
the central idea is that the power to tax is the power to destroy  theoretically  if the government wanted to destroy a disfavored religion  or it decided that all religions were disfavored   it could contrive a reason to impose really burdensome taxes on it to the point where it can no longer function  priests need to eat  and churches need to keep the lights on   this  of course  would violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the first amendment  so the government has decided  in an abundance of caution  to just not tax any religion for any purpose in the interest of maintaining the separation between church and state and honoring the first amendment ,-0.234
well  this gets right into a fundamental question of philosophy  where do morals come from  the historical answer  the one that  most   but not all  atheists refuse to acknowledge  is religion  western society is built from that pre supposition  our founding fathers certainly didn t have better solutions   well  without morals  life is just a cruel game of thrones and power  about who can squeeze the most out of it before someone else backstabs them  there is might still be moral people in such societies  but they usually end up with their heads on pikes to be shown off to their own daughters   so where do morals come from   well  the easy answer is still religion  and it seems to be the only answer that has any sort of popularity ,-0.021
 i absolutely see how imposing additional taxes on religious items should be illigal  that being said  taxing religions at the base rate everyone else pays should not be a problem  i fully understand priest need to eat  but so does everyone else  the government should subsidize religion by making exception to the law to benefit them  when a religious institution doesn t pay taxes  that tax burden gets shifted to everyone else  i should not have to pay higher taxes  even if its only a few cents  because the government decided to promote the spread of religion ,-0.042
first  how do you define advancement of religion  arguable every church could be accused of advancing religion by continuously practicing  spreading the word  adding new members  etc  would a church lose tax exempt status for putting up a billboard  what about a radio ad  a website   second  i used to work with a pastor who changed my view on this subject  he ran a small  local church and this subject came up  his point was that a ton of these small  local churches would not survive a sudden taxation  they barely cover their operating costs as is  ,-0.085
  there is might still be moral people in such societies  but they usually end up with their heads on pikes to be shown off to their own daughters   as long as most people are moral  this will not happen  if religious people were more likely to be moral  perhaps you would have a point  however  most religious people are moral and most atheist are moral  so this seems like a moot point  ,0.042
not if they actually do all the charitable work that those people think they are donating to support  and if they are not doing it  and people choose not to donate just to fund the church itself  so what  that may be a perfectly reasonable choice ,-0.042
since forever    we absolutely do not tax a companies revenue    we don t even tax a persons revenue when we file our income taxes    funny story  you can still deduct cogs even if you are running an illegal enterprise  think a drug dealer  when he files his taxes  he doesn t get to expense things like overhead  but he does get to expense the cost of the pure coke  ,0.0
i would in fact say that all churches do advance religion  all of that would be considered advancement of religion      i used to work with a pastor who changed my view on this subject  he ran a small  local church and this subject came up  his point was that a ton of these small  local churches would not survive a sudden taxation  they barely cover their operating costs as is   so  the government should not subsidize religion  if a religion can t sustain itself  the government should not impose higher taxes on the rest of the population to help it out  ,0.234

is there a requirement for exemption purposes that churches donate a certain amount of time money energy on public service  if there is  i have less of a problem with their tax exempt status than i thought i did,-0.167
actually to answer my own question  there is not   there are those massive  for profit  churches like the joel osteen one that make a ton of money off the people and are also exempt  i remember the john oliver sketch where he himself founded a tax exempt  church  to prove what a sham those churches are  i would not have a problem if there were a public service requirement  but as of now  there isn t ,0.13

why in this case should freedom of religion be superseded  should parents of healthy kids who chose not to vaccinate also be held responsible for their kids getting kids who cannot vaccinate sick ,-0.062
no  states impose those vaccination requirements for children enrolled in public school  and often private and occasionally parochial   in the majority of states  homeschooled children do not fall under that umbrella  parents don t have an actual duty to vaccinate their children  even setting the religious exemption aside    as for the religious exemption  it is exceedingly rare for us to impose an affirmative duty to violate your religion  even where other people s lives wellbeing are at stake  see  e g   religious exemptions for the draft and religious nonprofits getting waivers to not provide birth control under the aca  why do you think vaccines should be the place where we trample religious freedom  ,0.085
because in this case a persons beliefs can actually lead to harm to a child  think of it like this  if a persons religious beliefs involved throwing a knife at someone  would this be allowed  it is there religious belief and the knife may or may not actually harm the person  but it still would not be allowed  in this case not vaccinating the kid could potentially harm them  even kill them and therefore the duty to vaccinate should supersede religious beliefs   i m not sure what you are trying to say in the second part of your comment  please clarify that ,0.146
ok  it appears my understanding of the laws surrounding vaccines were flawed  this does not change my view though  i know believe it should be mandatory to vaccinate  at least for a few major diseases  and my original belief still holds  ,-0.167

you should be  but it would be impossible to prove ,-0.271
would it be impossible to prove  schools have on record which kids are and are not vaccinated and they know which kids are immune compromised  there was a story not long ago about a mother who is child had a compromised immune system from cancer  that child was never able to attend public school in their early years and when the child was in remission  but still could not get vaccinated  the parents wanted nothing more than to give their child a little bit of normality by attending public school  when the mother fuckeround out that one set of parents did not vaccinate their children  they had to decide if they would risk it or not for their own child    ,0.042

the flu vaccine uses small amounts of egg proteins  for adults this is not a problem because there is an eggfree option approved for those over the age of 18  for children they simply cannot get that specific vaccine if they have a serious egg allergy  the mmr vaccine also uses eggs  but is  generally  safe because the eggs are used to  produce  the vaccine,-0.188

yes  i was raised as a christian scientist  not scientology  by my mom and they explicitly forbid any form of medicine or drugs  i remember my mom saying she would never have vaccinated me if it hasn t been required by my school  compelling her to vaccinate very well may have saved my life  ,-0.021

certain vaccines cause shedding and immunocompromised people should not be around recently vaccinated people for this reason  a vaccinated person can get another person sick  so it would be impossible to prove and discriminatory to children who are not vaccinated  ,-0.191
just compare it to a kid dying of starvation  basically  depriving a kid of vaccines that is been scientifically tested and proven to work through years of trials  is the same as potentially killing him   another option is only letting people above a certain intelligence level be allowed to reproduce  then this would not be much of an issue  along with alot of other things  ,0.255
this sounds good in theory but it would be too hard to prove  too hard to enforce and there would have to be so many exceptions it would be unmanageable   the current system is doing just fine but there should be better and cheaper access to the immunizations  the percentage not vaccinated is minimal ,-0.312
i think the point is the parent would not be legally responsible if the child was vaccinated even if they contracted the disease  vaccinations are better for us as a species  herd immunity is important for those too young and those unable to get them for health reasons ,-0.277
you would have one hell of a time proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the lack of vaccination lead directly and causally to the death of the child  seeing as people get illnesses despite vaccination on a non zero chance basis  ,0.0

what if the immunization does not allow them the joys of  heaven   if you believe your destiny is predetermined than what is the point of immunizing preventable diseases   it s hard to understand the minds of others  especially those devout religious types  i am apatheistic  but it does seem that it is unfair on both sides  one way  your kid doesn t get to go to heaven  on the other you put people s lives at risk  it depends on your point of view   i d rather see people who are currently living alive  and worry about afterlife after death  it is tough ,-0.043
imagine being amish and being forced to go to a city and entering a place you believe to be absolutely evil  then you watch someone you despise stab your child with a needle and inject pure evil inside of them     and if you don t do that and your kids get sick  they will come with guns and arrest you and put you in a cage potentially for the rest of your life  anyone who resists will be killed  ,0.277
so if you let your child play on a main road and it gets run over you probably get charged with criminally negligent manslaughter   if you let your kid play on the road and a car comes along and hurts your kid severely  you still get charged with criminally negligience   if you let your kid play on the road and a car comes along and brakes in time  but still calls authorities you probably still get charged with criminally negligience  because of what could have happened   so with this in mind could you explain why you want to see parents punished if their kid dies  but not if it merely gets infected or merely is under risk of infection  shouldnt you ask to simply make vaccines mandatory  ,0.292
what about parents who allow their kids to drive a car  those are deadly  how about parents that allow their kid to drive a car that is a classic and doesnt have airbags  how about families that live in a house grandfathered into a previous fire code  what about parents that allow their kids to drink from a hose that contract meningitis  all those are examples of parents not taking preventative steps to protect their children   you re effectively trying to legislate parenting strategies   what if parents want to teach their kids to be communists  what if they want to teach their kids to hate jews  not tell them to do anything  just teach them to be anti semetic    at what point is the government allowed to force you to raise your kids the way they want you to ,0.375

if an antivaxxer s kid dies at the age of five from polio that is entirely the parents fault  however there is a certain price in blood we have to pay to live in a free society  the more control we hand over to the government to prevent an insignificant percentage of people from dieing just moves us closer to a police state  i think these people are killing their kids but i do not think we should put legislation in place to force government controlled vaccines on people  government regulations aren t the solution to everything  in some areas regulations are absolutely needed but in most cases it would not be a problem if we had a more educated population  we should not solve issues with unneeded growth of governmental power if it can be solved through better means ,0.292

i don t know how i feel about this  parents should be mandated to provide vaccines for most preventable conditions unless there is a medical reason not to    however   a parent losing their child is already horrible punishment  prison is not going to change anything  ,-0.083
personally i would rather see vaccinations mandatory and also free  nobody should be making money off of a way to provide health to others   if found guilty of not vaccinating then a fine will be issued  if your unvaccinated child is the cause of death of another  then the parent is charged with manslaughter   their is no reason why people should not be vaccinated  especially if it we are free   as it stands today i 100  am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids  if your child dies because you decided to not vaccinate then that is on you and i don t think you should be charged with anything  the loss of a child should be an eye opener and should weigh heavy on you ,0.156
what if they vaccinate but on a slightly delayed schedule  are they guilty of manslaughter if it happens  what if they briefly couldn t afford it and delayed for that reason  how much of the scheduling is itself actually based on empirical data ,0.167
you cannot prove a negative  that someone died because of a lack of vaccination  because no vaccine has ever proven to be 100  effective   also  it is very rare that someone dies because of whatever the vaccine is supposed to prevent  people die because of the effects of an illness which have a myriad of causes and effects  for example  aids doesn t kill people directly  it is the effects aids has that causes other failures of the human system  ,0.083
if a healthy kid gets autism after getting vaccinated then the manufacturer should be charged with child abuse and fined upkeep and therapy of the child for as long as the child needs it  ,0.045
prosecuting parents who refuse to vaccinate sounds reasonable but prosecuting people who spread disease through bad hygiene does not  why would that be  a flu bearing uncaught sneeze or unwashed hand is as dangerous to the immunocompromised as a poxed hippy child  and far more common  but the latter just seems worse   looking at it this way  a lot of this is about punishing people for holding the wrong opinion  the practical value is secondary  if it was about the practical value then real numbers would take centre stage in the argument rather than abstract musings about hypothetical children ,0.104

ok i have just discussed this with my mate and here was the outcome  borrowing something from another culture is not inherently disrespectful but requires a certain measure of sensetivity to that culture  i have in mind using a native american head dress as a party costume  you need to take in to account firstly the significance that that object has to it is native culture and secondly the history your group has with that group  does your group have a history of opressing that culture that is still relevant today and if so  would borrowing this object be figuratively rubbing salt in the wounds of that culture  if either of these things are true then i think its fair to be called out for cultural appropration with the negative connotation that it seems to carry ,0.062
i think you should note that cultural appropriation is often called out because people  accessorise  elements of other people s culture  as in  they are not making fun of it  but they are disregarding its importance  an example would be wearing a bindi because it looks pretty    would this be included in  people sincerely using and enjoying other parts of people s culture  ,-0.089

couldn t you though  as i have said above  i am not a believer in cultural appropriation  as a poc  but i can kind of understand their point  i just don t think people should get so militant about it    for example  i do feel rather annoyed sometimes when people don t appreciate something to the same depth that i do  i would say it is a similar mentality to gatekeeping   but of course in reality there are the additional factors of social disadvantage power imbalance discrimination to be considered when talking about cultural appropriation as opposed to being a fan of a game or music group ,0.043
it is not that your ancestors oppressed a culture directly  but that your ancestors were part of an oppressive imperialist culture which you still benefit from now  ,0.042
as a jewish person  i have shared jewish food with non jewish people dozens of times  while explaining some of the history and origins of the food or custom  it is great to share cultures with people  but if someone just starts taking jewish customs without knowing anything about the background  they aren t adopting the culture  they are diluting it  they are making it less meaningful  the jewish people have been oppressed for thousands of years  people have attempted to completely destroy jews and jewish culture for millennia  and taking aspects of jewish culture without any appreciation for the context of that culture is not flattering  it is diluting and erases the larger meanings behind the culture  which only serves to take away from the jewish people even more ,0.125
yes  the russian indentured peasants were the major beneficiaries of the imperialist culture  how could i have forgotten ,-0.128
  were the major beneficiaries  when did i say that   are you trying to argue that you get  no  benefit from the historic imperialism and oppression of people from different cultures  in the us  you benefit from being white as a result of the imperialism  ,0.062
why should we hold children accountable for the mistakes of their parents  i am willing to bet that every single person has had an ancestor who has done something deplorable  does that mean that we should go on a witch hunt to find who is ancestor harmed my ancestor so we can hold it over them and demand things from them  what happened to leaving the past in the past  learning from it so it doesn t happen again  and moving on  ,0.146
you said that my ancestors were  part of an oppressive imperialist culture   which is like saying that slaves are part of a slave culture  so forgive me that bit of sarcasm   and you are moving the goalposts  first it was my ancestors not being oprrssors of a culture   they werent   now apparently it is not good enough  because of the color of my skin i am responsible for something  ,0.217
that is not what i said  your entire comment is a straw argument ,-0.104
i am assuming that the straw man you are referring to is where i talk about witch hunts  while i don t think that that is a straw man  you clearly do so let s ignore that for now and just address the first question  is it alright to punish people for the faults of their ancestors  to be more specific  is it right to deem certain actions and behaviors  such as wearing a native american headdress  acceptable or unacceptable based on the faults of your ancestors  ,0.17
who is ancestors were not part of an oppressive culture  what i mean is  who has ancestors that did not expand into territory claimed by others ,0.062
the point is that some people today still benefit from their ancestors   not strictly genetic ancestors  but cultural ancestors  imperialism and oppressive actions  and some people today still suffer as a result of their ancestors being colonized and oppressed  ,0.042
i think it is more accurate to say that this nonsense is pushed by people who want to project a virtuous image of trying to protect the rights of minorities  i am reminded of a protest at a japanese embassy  in portland i think  where college activists tried to shut down a  wear a komono  event  being held by the friendly  and now puzzled  embassy staf fuck this term    cultural appropriation    only exists inside an extremely toxic academic ideology  the real term is  transcultural diffusion   and generally speaking  only people with strong racist tendencies have a problem with people doing it ,-0.021
this topic already blew up but i will still try  i see this as a real issue and people apply the legitimate criticism to things that don t apply  i also see many examples where people should criticize the nature of capitalism not race relations   example  if someone takes an indigieonous style and has it replicated in china and also uses images and connotations from that culture  that company stole that from the culture and undercut that cultures own products they are making with no benefit    ,0.0
honestly  after reading a lot of the best rated comments as a response to your question  i still agree with your initial view  the bad aspects of cultural appropriation are when you misrepresent the culture in malicious ways that take away from the nature of that culture  however  that is most often done either in ignorance or hatred that is often fueled by racism    when you attempt to experience culture with genuine intent  i can t see any harm as long as you maintain an ability to take advice or criticisms from people of that culture in order to better experience their culture  everything else is a societal personal issue that just becomes more apparent while that person shares their view of another culture  ,0.042
 i don t count people playing on stereotypes for comedy or making fun of people s cultures by copying them as part of this argument  i mean people sincerely using and enjoying parts of other people s culture  1  who gets to decide what is appropriating and what is appreciating  if you ask the person accused of appropriating  they will almost always say it is an expression of appreciation   2  which parts of the culture do you choose to accept or reject  do you wear the funny headdress  but ignore the communities of people living in poverty  who are having their land torn up to make way for a pipeline that will continue to pollute their drinking water ,-0.104
 dumb ing down your culture   to appease another for the sake of appeasement is stupid  respecting and acknowledging the good in each is important   but bashing an incumbent culture   because it is not as it was where you came from is disrespectful in itself  your the guest   respect the host ,0.021
sensitivity to whom in that culture  cultures aren t some uniform singular thing  not everyone within likes every aspect or respects every aspect so you are still choosing to respect the image and narrative put out by a group who is voice is the loudest  no one gets to decide what is or is not sacred for others  ,-0.188
cultural appropriation is not a step backwards  however denying the negative power of cultural appropriation on traditionally marginalized communities is a huge step backwards ,-0.271
how are they diluting your culture with what they do  though   they aren t affecting jewish culture  because they aren t jews  they are affecting their own culture and it seems a little big headed to assume the position that you should have any say in how they run their own culture ,0.106
 similar mentality to gatekeeping  i think you hit the nail on the head  here  this is exactly what this is    you don t get to use this because it is mine and you aren t a  true    and only  true   s get to use this ,0.042
to appropriate something  by definition  means to take without permission    the visceral reaction from minorities is that of a poor person having their belongings stolen by a rich person  perhaps minorities would not be opposed to sharing that aspect of their culture had it been asked of them  instead  it was stolen  indicating that the thought of respect for people like them or their property never occurred to them  and to add insult to injury  the thieves wear their stolen goods in front of those they stole it from  then claim that their being upset is jeopardizing their relationship  ,0.021
they are taking something jewish and making it not jewish  they are separating it from its cultural context  which takes away from the jewish identity ,-0.062
itt  op never learning about black face    but because the mod is a fickle c  t i am gonna see if i can hit the word threshold  now let s see a guatamalan named ned tried to be a mexican for profit  mickey rooney tried to be asian on  breakfast at tiffany s   dave chapelle drew the line at black face and  a russian asset is pretending to be president  some things hurt and detract from us as a whole  that is why we gotta call mother fuck out  ,0.625
 takes away from the jewish identity  you are gonna have to do a lot more to convince me that is actually happening than just saying it does  so i guess the cowboy identity died because everyone started wearing blue jeans   thinking    they aren t taking anything away except a sense of smug purity that you might have otherwise had access to  gatekeeping is totally a thing you  can  do  i just would not suggest it  since all it does is make you bitter   they aren t taking anything away  they are duplicating  modifying and adapting it  the original is still there  unchanged  just the way you want it and have always had it  the difference is now a few more people are eating bagels  the horror   although you guys clearly culturally appropriated bagels from the mesopotamians  since they are made out of flour  for shame ,0.167
mixing cultures homogenizes them into one  usually with the previously dominant culture having the most representation in the new homogenized culture    mixing cultures sounds like it would work to stop racism  but it won t  some things just can t mix  how would one mix a monotheistic religion with a polytheistic one  you couldn t  you would have to omit parts of cultures to blend in with others  ,-0.188
i mostly agree with you  some people want everything to belong to one race or another  for example i saw latina women mad because women of other races were wearing hoop earrings  earrings  things like that are not cultural appropriation  its not cultural   something that is appropriation is using religious symbols as fashion  or taking something and lessoning its value  for example  bindis  they are a religious piece of great importance they aren t a part of fashion   i feel like for it to be appropriation the value or perceived value has to be changed  earrings mean as much to a black person as the do to a white person  a traditional headdress means something of deep value  someone who isnt native wearing cheapens its value and makes it seem worthless does that make sense ,0.229
it is only a problem when it is exploitative  like white girls wearing bindis and then selling said bindis and then marketing them as dharma dots or dots not feathers  an insulting marketing of another culture that disrespects said culture to make money  though this kind of naked exploitation is rarely tolerated on any serious scale so not really a usual concern  i agree that cultural ideas exchanged and flowing between people is not an issue  but exploitation does happen  i think the key problem is that we all spend too much time on the internet which is notorious for magnifying insignificant outliers nitpicking minor complaints reflective of new problems in society  it seems that random tweens on tumblr don t make the best communicators of critical post colonial theory ,0.021
it is also a direct result of diversity  yet forbidden    pick one,-0.167
there is a difference between myself enjoying a bagel with lox and  i don t know  having my husband wear a yamikah because i think it is sex   one is enjoying something the other is disrespectful,0.104
 i think what the problem is would be non people of color taking poc culture and not giving credit and also not sticking up for the rights of those said poc when it is time to stand up  kinda like ok you can take my culture and benefit  use it to your advantage for style  money whatever but when it comes to my rights you will not stick up for me  but you like my culture  and i feel from what i have seen at least is that is what upsets people    again this is just what i have seen  ,0.042
i think that the big problem here is simply the of authenticity    i mean if you say that you make genuine italian food and you don t you are attacking the idea of genuine italian food by passing the crap that you are making as the real deal    italians do have the right to be upset there    same idea goes when we take rich cultures and turn them into mascots  we take ceremonial garb of people we conquered and turn it into a costume    it is not a costume  it is a sacred headdress    so if a non italian makes italian food  but they make the good stuff and uphold italian cooking traditions than they should be fine  if they are simply riding the coat tails than people do have a valid right to complain ,-0.042
do you know that feeling when you see someone wearing a t shirt of your favorite band and then you talk with them and realize they hardly know the band at all  and you are left thinking   so  why are you wearing this t shirt if you don t understand what it means  that is so distasteful and superficial    cultural appropriation is like that  but much stronger because it is not about taste but more commonly about symbols that speak to your very identity  so that distastefulness is amplified and can become almost like an insult for some people because it contributes to banalize something you hold dear   then you are going to have people taking this concept and taking it too far  but that should be ignored  ,0.104
since culture and race are two separate things  how would accepting  culture appropration  end racism ,-0.062
culture is part of race identity  or are you really arguing there is no link  ,-0.213
i am saying that they are two different things and accepting culture appropriation will not end racism    racism is merely based in race  not culture  ,0.188
but there is a link and accepting one helps the other  i am not saying it alone will end it  but it certainly helps  ,-0.521
how is this  association  relevant to ending racism  you still haven t explained how accepting culture appropriation would help end racism  you are just saying it would without explaining how    just because it is common for many people of the same race to share many aspects of the same culture doesn t mean anything  it really doesn t mean there is a link  race doesn t determine your culture and culture doesn t determine your race   i don t think you understand what racism is  ,0.292
a lot of racism comes from demonising  making fun of and ultimately not understanding aspects of certain races culture and traditions  its not all races and it is not all culture  but it is a large amount  ,0.167
 a lot of racism comes from   again  racism is merely based in race  not culture    racism would be to assume all people of a certain race participate and accepts a culture or certain aspects of a culture that you disagree with or dislike    or to only have an issue with people of a certain race that participate accept the culture or aspect of that culture you disagree with    so how would not condemning culture appropriators change that mindset   ,0.213
lindsay ellis has a great video on cultural appropriation  it boils down to the fact that ca is not inherently bad  look at disney s recent lineup of films from coco to moana  they all respected and understood the culture they portrayed  even though their creators were ostensibly american  by taking the time to understand   properly portray a culture  the appropriation becomes a method to better learn about other cultures instead of shamelessly taking   misrepresenting another group of people ,-0.261
the public should absolutely contribute money to things that are in the public good   the public should not contribute money to thing that make a few individuals more wealthy     but what about things that that are both in the public good and make a few individuals more wealthy    a city should not make bad business deals or let itself get taken advantage of  but that does not necessitate never helping to build a public stadium ,-0.062
that would open the door to more conspiracy theories than we are already dealing with ,-0.312
news outlets report news that the general public is interested in  and unfortunately  the general public is intrigued by these people  even if msm considered not reporting these mass shooters for this exact reason  smaller outlets and lone individuals would try to investigate for themselves because there would still be a demand  potentially leading to the spreading of misinformation  ,-0.042
no you have it backwards  people are interested at whatever is interesting and up in their faces  the media doesn t follow public opinions and interests it creates them  just like a coca cola ad along with coca cola availability everywhere creates a need for sweet sparkling poison water that was not there in the first place   the evidence for repeated mass shootings is there  it is worth a shot   note i am not saying the media want to promote mass shootings  they just happen to lack morality other than  profit is good  ,0.0
so media outlets should just suppress information from everyone because it might inspire another shooter  it is not like it is a secret  people will figure out the guys name anyway if they were really that interested  potential copycats    and who is supposed to pressure them  the government ,0.0
well the viewers would be the ones to pressure them  and there is a distinction to be made between the information being available  and it being constantly plastered on the news for weeks on end  i understand your point that it is suppressing information  but i am not sure what value the information has ,-0.167
they only plaster it because people want to see it ,-0.277
you make a good point as far as the misinformation goes  and i don t doubt that lone individuals would be able to search out the information anyway  but it could reduce the  benefit  of fame that perpetrating a mass shooting has  i am not sure if the misinformation aspect would outweigh the possible benefits  but it is certainly something to think about ,-0.125
it seems to be working just fine in finland   i m not sure that it really would open the door to more conspiracy theories though  i mean i don t think anyone is saying don t report on the shootings  we are just saying don t turn the shooters into celebrities  and celebrities is a good word for a lot of these shooters  many of them have become household names with the amount of coverage they have received   i don t agree with a government ban but i think the media should self regulate here just as the finnish press did a decade ago  ,0.196
imagine this practice has already been enacted   no shooter s identity or image is ever released  the copycat will still know them as the pulse nightclub shooter who killed 50 people or the las vegas shooter who killed 58 people   what difference does knowing one s identity make to a potential copycat  i can t imagine this being as effective as you think it will be  the news will report locations and casualty totals and that is really what is remembered after a shooting ,0.152
knowing that your name and face will become the main story for a few weeks could be enough for someone who is already deranged and fallen ,-0.167
or maybe they don t care and are just trying to get a better  high score   that is a type of copycat that would not be affected by ops suggestion ,-0.021
a  high score  which would be announced to everyone in the nation for weeks 24 7  very appealing to the fuck up ,0.375
the fact that this doesn t help in all cases is not sufficient to not do this  obviously it will not end school shooting  but if it prevents some portion of cases it seems reasonable  same thing with gun control  the argument is not that it will stop all violence  just some of the gun violence ,-0.042
if the  profit is good  sentiment is true how would the media determine what to broadcast in the first place   also the coca cola analogy is flawed because you are talking about a product that was not in demand because it simply didn t exist  if coca cola were to go out of business today do you genuinely believe there would not be a demand for it ,-0.229
would not they prefer a high score knowing everyone around the state country world will see their name and face beside it   if we take their name face away from news reports once the attacker is not a threat to the public anymore  then the fame notoriety goes away  this will not stop copycats 100  but it will reduce the appeal if there is no recognition  ,-0.208
the news channels need to because they aren t in it to inform the public but to make money  they get their money from viewers and the viewers choose to go to the news channels that give them the information they want  if channel a is talking about the shooting but not giving a name  and channel b is giving the name  it tells the viewer they should be watching b to get the fuller story  im not going to go to a channel that explicitly tells me they will not give all the information for any reason ,0.213
thats not as crazy as you make it sound  for example  in germany there is an industry wide agreement to not report on people commiting suicide by jumping in front of trains  and it made the numbers go down considerably  and i have not heard of any government pressure  its jsut the right thing to do,-0.106
the us media does a similar thing with not reporting details or cause of death for the vast majority of suicides ,-0.021
conpiracy theories should just be ignored by everyone ,-0.298
it is up to the morality of journalists how to portray the perpetrator  an interesting option i have seen is tv stations using a strange picture of the las vegas shooter  not a glamorous one  however  everything that was not openly published to the public allowed for various conspirational theories to emerge  which is possibly one of the worst outcomes out of a shooting ,-0.083
journalists have literally the most important job in western society   if we don t have the most horrible crimes imaginable being shoved in our faces at every moment  do have any idea how much money journalists will lose  people don t want  news   they want horror and woe jammed into their eyeballs 24 7   to even  suggest  that journalists have any responsibility to be responsible  or even report the truth  is basically putting them up against the wall and murdering them  we have no right to expect  anything  from our brave journalists aside from what they want us to know ,0.062
you are assuming that news outlets want there to be fewer mass shootings  the evidence suggests that this is not the case  every time there is one  they get more viewers  and they also get to do a  2 minutes hate  against the gun culture that they hate ,0.0
ah yes  perfect is impossible so why bother with improvement right ,-0.277
a lot of these mass casualties attacks don t seem to trying to  beat the high score  otherwise you would think they would be much more effective at it ,0.022
how many mass shootings happen in finland ,0.0
you are being sarcastic and contributing nothing  if you agree with op don t post ,0.042
yes  how can it work fine or not fine if it doesn t ever get implemented ,-0.188
keeping the information out of the public record is obviously a poor choice  censoring or otherwise preventing the media from reporting public record info is also absurd  so what is left  the media being responsible to not glorify killers  vote with your eyeballs and attention  your premise is flawed ,0.319
how about they report the news  instead of figuring out the best way to manipulate it ,-0.354
there would be no way to keep the shooter s  or multiple shooters  name out of the press  and even if there were a way to arrest and or prosecute them without it coming out  the details of the shooting are likely the thing that would generate a copycat shooting  not the shooter s name ,0.208
las vegas was an illegal arms deal that went bad and was covered up by the govt to be a mass shooting  fact  and its a fact cus they have hidden much of what we know about this case  now get rid of what little info they did relaee and it will be even more of a fact ,0.167
it would not be a secret but there would be no glory in it and that is the point  the sickos that do these things often want that glory and doing this would certainly depress it  this type of argument is found in so many discussions which basically goes  it will not fix 100  of the problem therefore the solution will not work ,0.146
are you proposing that all the news outlets get together and voluntarily agree to this or that we enact legislation that would prohibit them from releasing that information  because if it is the latter then that is a violation of our first amendment rights ,-0.128
 while i understand an outright ban would cut against the first amendment  news outlets should be pressured to voluntarily follow this guideline   last sentence of my original post  ,-0.208
i never said keep it out of public record  in fact i specifically point to the fact that it would be available in other comments  i also stated in the last sentence of my post that i am not talking about government censorship  i am talking about the public pressuring these outlets to refrain  which as you state would likely be through choosing outlets which do not report this information  or letting them know in some other way that you would prefer this information be left out  my premise is voting with your eyeballs and attention  i think we are on the same page then ,-0.125
in that case then  i suppose there is not much discussion to be had  i understand the inclination to have as much information as possible  and i see its merits  i personally think that the specific information here has little value  but if you begin with the assumption that no information should ever be left out for any reason regardless of value or effect the reporting may have  then i think we may be too far apart on the overarching premise ,-0.271
i don t think we are that far apart  really i agree with your idea i just don t think it is feasible in the current state of news and media  as to your title  if a news channel refrains from naming the killer they will lose viewers  and they need to to maintain their viewers to maintain their company and profits  so while i disagree with them and personally think they spend too much time sensationalising these events for viewers and ratings  i understand why they do it and think they are right to do what they need to stay relevant and in profit          ,-0.042
media companies are struggling for revenue as it is  they need to make as much money as possible to ensure a free press continues to exist  if they need to sensationalize school shootings to do it  then that is just the way it is ,-0.25
in regards to application  it is certainly reliant on public opinion being in favor of the information not being reported  assuming they report the information because people like to see it  which i think is a fair assumption  the only solution would be to get people to stop wanting to see it  this might be an unrealistic solution  but i don t think it is an impossible one ,-0.085
yep  sorry  i think where you lost me was  pressuring  which read like censorship to me ,0.042
i suppose pressuring is a bit broad of a term  but i am not sure if there is a better word to describe it succinctly ,-0.312
i agree  glad to see you at least accept that the people s opinion and the fact that the media is reliant on that opinion drives how news is presented  i see a lot of people on here who want their ideal situation to be true and don t care that it is not feasible or unwanted by either people or companies,-0.043
i have seen little evidence that most mass shooters do it for  fame   motives seem to be divided among revenge anger  start a revolution against govt  start a race religious war  and incoherent unknown   probably the most common motive is anger revenge  that is why most shooters choose a target relevant to them  their school  their workplace  their house  a church used by the race they hate  a nightclub they went to  if they were looking for fame  they would be more likely to choose a big soft target at random  somewhere with really no connection to them ,0.391
not naming people is not going address the underlying problems  these people don t become mental because of the news  they have issues which are not being addressed by society   news should stop calling them shooters  shooters are people who shoot for sport  people who kill people are called murderers ,0.333
they want to sell advertising and would whore out their children if allowed  cut the cable and save yourself  ,-0.083
i have an even better idea  keep reporting on the name of the scumbags  but also include their penis size in the reports ,0.125
their names and kill counts are plastered on the 24 hour stations for days on end like it is a score card ,-0.128
i don t think they should completely refrain from showing it  news is news  what they should stop doing is showing the shooter s face 95 times a day and recapping the event with round the clock coverage to politicize the shooting and ultimately glorifying the shooter  ,0.042
people have the right to know what happened  they shouldnt be deprived of knowing what the shooter looks like and other stuff,-0.375
most people opposed to the protest don t even know the cause  do they  so many people seem to think it is about protesting the flag  or the armed services  or something   the problem they have is with  who  is protesting ,0.021
they complain when black people riot  and tell them to find some other way to protest peacefully     they complain when black people block roads  and tell to find some other way to protest peacefully     when they find a way to protest peacefully  they still find a way to have a problem with it     it just leads me to believe that they want black people to just know their place and shut up  or protest in a way that is not visible ,0.191
i don t care about the color of the skin of the protester  if it is going to inconvenience me  i will be annoyed  if it breaks the law  the protester should be arrested ,0.104
and the anthem protesters aren t breaking any laws  they are hurting certain peoples feelings  that is it ,0.0
i know  but that doesn t make them less annoying ,-0.106
thank you for the support  and that is fine we are allowed to have different opinions  just figured i would throw in my two cents   ,-0.604

and then declining to spend money at the nfl  which hurts the nfl s feelings  so the nfl bans kneeling because they want the money   simple stuff ,0.167
  left handed discrimination  i have heard literally everything now  holy fuck shit  ,0.667
mate  until you have been there  faced with right handed mouses and scissors and pens    you wont understand  its  like  a totes tragedy     to get in before someone makes a fool of themselves  ever had a pen you twist to expose the nib  yeah  left handers cant use them because  as you write  the pen twists back the other way and the nib disappears  ever tried a fountain pen when your hand follows on behind the writing and smearing the ink  so  right handed pens are a thing   oh  but the above is  s in the event that anyone is confused  ,0.0
the discrimination comes more from the lesbianism if the  s was not obvious   however i will add that people that are left handed have a shorter average lifespan due to most things being designed for right handed people  leading to more accidents   ,-0.021
does it actually cost the nfl money though  i am legitimately asking  i haven t seen any analytics that can attribute a loss of revenue to kneeling ,-0.375
while laws are rules  not all rules are laws  no one is breaking the law by kneeling  they may be breaking rules  but that is much less serious than breaking a law ,-0.125
if the players were white and kneeling for vets or any other social injustice  there would be no issue  ,0.125
because when an nfl player is on the field  they are at work  and now a requirement of their employment is that if they are on the field  they must stand and sing the national anthem hand over heart  if they don t want to do that  they are free to stay in the locker room until the game starts  which is more than nba players get    when you are at work  or when i am at work  we are expected to leave our politics at the door  and pursue them outside of company hours  and the reason why is a political display on the job is liable to cause unnessacary divisions amongst your colleagues and turn off customers and clients and potential customers and clients ,-0.234
i actually think if the players were making an earnest pretest about a veterans issue that is anymore complicated than a bland  support the troops  you would get a similiar blowback    american is probably just as unwilling to confront it is status as a world police force that uses it is young  largely rural population  largely from historically military families   thereby concentrating the burden of service   if the players were to protest to an end to all american interventionism  or the closure of all foreign bases in countries we ended wars with 50  years ago  or for a total end to our drone assassination program  the point is both the fact that there is an unpalletable protest  black people are humans  and that it is occurring during america s sport   a time for escapism from what is increasingly a state of total politicization across all aspects of life ,0.104
 it has to do with intent if they were intending to honor the flag by kneeling nobody would care but they were intending to dishonor it  it is like when rosie o donnell sung the national anthem like shit and everybody was mad at her it was because she intended to do job she intended to be disrespectful  it is not the people find singing disrespectful it was the intent to use it in a besmirching way  ,0.375
it is definitely partly the cause  but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted  kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served  kneeling for blm inspired protest of perceived injustice to african americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that  1  lumps all police officers together as bad   2  divides black vs white   3  exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races  and  4  judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018  add to that that the controversial  predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain    for those who interpret it that way  including some black people  it seems like the wrong time and place  as well as too easily misinterpreted   ,0.229
i didn t say i disagreed  i said it was annoying  i can 100  agree with something someo mr e is doing and also think it can be annoying ,-0.021
it is part the kneeling bc it is directed at the american flag  it is a consciousness decision not to salute  to some it looks likes a lesser kind of flag burning   but you are right that the reaction is not just about the way the message is conveyed but the message itself  colin kaerernick represents a movement that many see as very hostile to themselves ,-0.021
wasnt it a veteran team member that suggested collin kneel instead of sit out the anthem out of respect for vets ,-0.261
kneeling for veterans would not be perceived as imposing a negative connotation in the flag or anthem  not the case with the protests ,0.146
its not the cause its the color  the amount of white people who are  annoyed and aren t going to be quiet about it  in regards to african americans is only growing  this is also the reasons that so many of obama s policies are being overturned undone  its not that they are all that bad  its just because the black guy did them  ,0.396
i don t take any issue with it but i can see people finding a difference between kneeling for veterans versus against racism  one is hommage  the other is protest  ,-0.354
the way i see it is that  while kneeling is not disrespectful  doing it during the anthen can be taken that way as opposed to standing with your hand over your heart  the nfl is a private company and they lost their sponsorship with papa john s along with loss of views  at the end of the day it was costing them money  keep politics out of sports  ,0.25
reading through the comments i have seen a few that make the case for it is a who and a cause issue  i agree with those posts and this morning had an epiphany as to why the nfl s decision rubbed me the wrong way  i will state it it question form    if the people kneeling during the national anthem were the white players and were protesting to maintain their 2nd amendment rights  would the response have been the same by the fans  politicians  and the nfl    i think that the answer is that very few would have spoken against it  ,-0.062
i disagree completely  i think your assumption that it would be a non issue is just wrong  there are many people  older veterans particularly  who would say it is the act of kneeling  not the cause  the believe in standing tall and proud for the flag  ,-0.125
when tim tebow was kneeling in prayer  not during the anthem  just during the game  every one is up and arms about  don t put your religious stuff on me   now that the shoe is on the other foot  people are getting upset  how about we just return football to what it was  a game  and leave the religion and politics out of it ,0.333
its not that its offensive necessarily however the nfl is a buisness and when those numbers started dipping down from people protesting the kneeling by not showing up  the nfl got scared  whether they agree with the cause or not is irrelevant they were losing money  and anything short of a mass player strike or a supreme court ruling deeming it unconstitutional  it will continue to be a policy  otherwise it would be a publicicity nightmare ,-0.191
it is fake oppression  they are protesting  opression  that is not as huge of a problem as they think it is  racially speaking  ,0.062
the protests might have been about police brutality when it was kaepernick and one other guy doing it  but this really blew up after trump said the nfl should fire players that take a knee during the anthem  after that  a whole bunch of players started doing it  so that tells me it was more of a   fuck trump  thing  then you have instances like lesean mccoy doing calisthenics during the anthem  the ravens kneeling for the us anthem and then standing for  god save the queen  in the uk  and marshawn lynch sitting for the us anthem in mexico  but standing for their national anthem   cause mexican cops totally aren t corrupt or brutal       so yes please point out where those who are against the protests are missing how  respectful  it is  ,0.438
i don t think it is  just  the cause  it is also the color of the protestors and the fact that many of them are rich ,0.0
i have never seen people kneel during services for veterans  such as military funerals  they give the military salute ,-0.479
this may be true  but not for the reason you think   peoples are upset because  for one  they feel as though it disrespects veterans  so kneeling to bring attention to their plight would be viewed differently for that reason ,0.271
viewership is going up  when did this happen  ,-0.625
kaep had the top selling jersey in  16 and  17 ,-0.326
does this matter  if overall viewership is decreasing  ticket sales are decreasing  does it matter if he had the top selling jersey of an increasingly smaller pool of potential buyers    i m sure the nfl is totally reassured while they hemorrhage viewers  you don t seem to understand the big picture ,-0.213
kneeling has fuck to do with decreased viewership and anyone who believes otherwise is a moron  people are watching less football because 3 hours of ads to watch an hour of game is not competitive in the modern media market ,0.667
mate  if you think kneeling has had zero effect on viewership  you are naive  the nfl   clearly   thinks kneeling is having an effect on viewership    or they would not be doing what they are doing   ,0.043
viewership has been falling for the better part of a decade  is kaepernick a time traveler  even managers in other sports leagues are remaking on how stupidly the nfl has been managing this ,0.043
the two main sentiments are 1 a lack of patriotism shown and 2 inappropriate time to protest  i would guess a majority of the people who believe it is an inappropriate time to protest would still think it would be inappropriate to protest if it was a different issue  ex  veterans   for cause 1  it would be a question of whether or not the person values the national anthem flag more  or veterans  if we combine those two groups  i would safely assume that still a majority of people would be offended by it  it is not the cause for the most part  it is the act of kneeling during the national anthem ,-0.021
 protect people from getting beaten up  stabbed  rape   etc   to be fair  prisons already do this  it is not as if prisons openly encourage rape like  welp  hey  you are in prison now so anything goes     i think much of the rhetoric you hear is probably a scare tactic deterrent to make people  really  not want to go to prison break laws  ,0.234
i know  but that it is such a common part of our social narrative means that those efforts are clearly insufficient  ,-0.468
it is part of the  social  narrative  if you talk to ex cons  there have been several amas over the years with ex cons  prison rape is relatively rare ,0.043
i used to do  40 hr contracts at prisons  now those contracts go straight to the trash  prisons are incredibly dangerous even with my personal escorts  ,-0.188
i would also be careful about assuming that something is true because its a common part of our social narrative  there are tons of things that are common in social narratives that either completely wrong  or  not nearly as simple or straight forward as people think   but sorry for the side bar  i am not sure the rules on changing views of views within the view we are supposed to change lol  ,-0.125

it is an important point  though  is prison rape a joke  an urban legend   or is it a fact   i don t know the answer   though i expect prison experiences vary depending on where you sent ,0.208
it seems to be but if you look at empirical data and facts and statistics  rape is more previewing in prisons but still very rare  ,0.0
it is not as widespread as the people making those comments would have you believe  my mother and i had both worked at detention centers and at least in those  there was not prison rape going on  if a dude wanted to fuck he let it be known  packs of gay guys were not roaming around raping dudes like in shawshank redemption  ,0.833
there are about 200 0 reported rapes in prisons each year  by contrast  there are about 90 0 reported rapes in the general population each year  your exposure risk as an inmate is still low  but the rate of occurrence is many times more than the national average  ,0.146
i bet the rate of prison rapes varies considerably from one prison to another ,0.125
yeah prison rape definitley feels like something that is way more talked about in american culture media as being a thing in prison    i m sure many americans will not believe me but it really is not anywhere as much as a thing in british prisons as it is in american prisons  based on accounts from people who have been to prison in america and people who have been in british ones,0.104
i can say that you can t give blood if you have ever spent more than 72hrs in prison,-0.25
it absolutely does  california and louisiana have serious problems with it  ,-0.277
considering how closely prisoners are monitored  i suspect the reporting rate is much higher there than in the general population  ,-0.229
i reckon a lot of rapes go unreported due to fear of retribution by other inmates ,0.125
yup  it is called rape culture  ,0.191
you do realize that rape is not that common in prison right  basically 99  of the time  the only men in prison having sex are men that want to be having sex   the only people who expect others to be rape in prison are people who don t know what prison is like ,0.426
i usually only hear this said about rapists   pedophiles it seems like a  just  punishment to some people bc its kinda an eye for an eye  ,0.125
wikipedia articles cite percentages between 3 5 and 15  whereas the former is often considered too conservative so i would say you have a point op    however i urge you to consider the motive behind incarceration as it occurs in the us and many other countries now  as i see it there are 4 main motives   1  punishment  2  rehabilitation  3  deterrent  4  protection of  normal  citizens   i would argue that if you look at the outcome  high sentences  strong chance of actually getting worse in prison  sexual violence  overcrowding  etc   you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4  if you rehabilitate in jail that is great and i suppose you will be supported  but its clearly not the main driving force  so the question perhaps should be rephrased to   what do we as a society want the result of incarceration to be   ,-0.167
prison rape stories can also be used to scare people away from prison  because what is scarier than a large man beating your cheeks  the answer is nothing  ,0.208

i think all the animal behavior experts recognize that positive reinforcement works better than negative reinforcement amd recividism rates appear to mirror this so i am gonna try and urge you to change your view to the following   there is something profoundly wrong with a society that reasonably expects punitive measures such as fines  imprisonment  and torture to reduce crime and improve society ,-0.022
so america s society understands the reality of imprisonment  and the high likelihood of being rape while in prison  in its current state  as a coping mechanism for a horrific failure of the prison system  we make light of our system with jokes  joking about one of the worst failures seems to make sense to me  ,0.062
this isnt true for all prisons though  it is only in male prisons  whenever a woman goes to prison the first thing people think about is the family they are leaving behind and feel sympathy   society has no sympathy for the male who can no longer provide a service  only women  children and pets are given unconditional love in western society     chris rock ,0.043

  such a common part of our social narrative   when i was in law school  my criminal law professor asked the class how many of us thought that prison rape was morally wrong  or  in other words  how many of us believed prison rape should not be considered a natural consequence of criminal conviction   in a class of  50  me and one other student were the only two hands raised  current lawyers ,0.083
     cmv  there is something profoundly wrong with society       i ll stop you right there,-0.149
i don t have hard data  but i have to think that prison rape has been around long enough  and is ubiquitous enough  that it is certainly not an  american  thing  prison culture has always been a might   right kind of thing  and rape is all about power ,0.104
private prisons are an anathema  especially those not allowing early release to maintain their profits  rape is widespread in prisons and it is a favourite weapon where gangs are prevalent  you are correct in saying it is a double sentence ,-0.062

problem is prisons are overcrowded and underfunded a lot of times  not enough guards to go around and you can t have eyes on the inmates 24 7  are there cases where guards look the other way when things happen  sure  but that is not the norm  if i were to be sent to a state pen today i would be more worried about getting jumped by another inmate than rape    ,-0.021
is not that a good thing tho  at very least it adds another reason not to commit a crime  maybe someone doesn t mind being locked up  but being rape on the other hand can be a pain in the ass ,0.625
  hoping that they will redeem and repent is laughable   thing is that when you are given a long sentence  it is less about becoming a changed person and more about joining a community  the real issue with prisons is that they waste tax payer s money  and as you said  they don t rehabilitate those who need it  we need mercy not judgment  and mercy doesn t have to be all nice either   rather than let someone rot in prison for 40 years  just execute them  put them out of their misery  but what can you do  crime is profitable ,0.062

i think what your position lacks  as outlined in the op  is hard evidence of any kind  it is tough to argue opinion and subjective perception  for example  i haven t heard people make those jokes since i was in high school  and that age range hardly represents society as a whole   does that change your view    if you are interested in changing your view  i would recommend seeking out hard data on the topic    personally  i have never assumed it happened all that often  but with data  maybe  you  could  my  mind   in this scenario  i fall back on the adage  that which can be asserted without evidence  can be dismissed without evidence   edit  formatting  ,-0.188
i really don t see what the big deal is  america is fuck up right now  you are right  if they were kneeling for veterans it would not be seen as an issue  i see how people could find it disrespectful  but at the same time it is disrespectful to deny the fact that blacks are unrightfully targeted by the police sometimes  there is definitely an issue  the united states is not united  i don t care if they kneel  because i know it is not coming from a place of disrespect  but more so shame  and pain  it concerns me when people are so nationalistic about their country  ,0.458
the change was likely made for two reasons  1  to create a more user friendly  modern looking site  this is subjective  but the layout is in line with modern design 2  they have a more unified experience between desktop  tablet  and mobile web with the new layout  for better or worse 2 is a very common thing for sites with heavy cross use use  it makes a much easier codebase to maintain and allows for better unification of experience   as to why it may not be working for you the only thing i can think of is content blockers  there is a ton of js   requests going on with the new layout and even on desktop it did not work well for me until i swapped it to be less image heavy ,-0.375
personally  i always liked using reddit but i did not use it anywhere close to as much until they launched their mobile app  i do most of my internet on my phone and the old reddit was crap on it  minus the fact that there was not even an app  the overwhelming majority of people s interneting happens on mobile  disclaimer  i am not sure how much the redesign had to do with the mobile app but i believe they happened around the same time,-0.188
just to give a different view  from a modding perspective  the redesign finally adds  or is in the process of adding  a lot of native tools that help make moderation a lot easier for new mods  you don t have to be a css wizard now to set up a good looking subreddit  there are native removal reasons that will hopefully end up in mobile apps instead of being a computer only feature from toolbox  flair filtering is finally happening  posting requirements will work properly instead of having automod remove posts and comments   yes  there are a lot of complaints from mods about the redesign  but the improvements made by admins over the past few months have been incredible and show that they are listening to feedback  just check  r redesign weekly and you will see ,-0.146
fair for y u  but if some users can t  is that not a problem  many  inappropriate  given where we are  response i have gotten were form people who had no functional problems  but still hated that change   to the op  can you give a single benefit from the change ,-0.354
but you are the only user i have heard of this happening to  so it seems like an isolated incident  and idk  i like the look so i would say that is a plus  it is also easier to read conversations threads you are in from the messages tab ,-0.167
  to create a more user friendly  i m a user and i feel like an enemy    they have a more unified experience between desktop  tablet  and mobile web with the new layout    i ve used all three and never felt  un unified   to that point  as a mobile user i feel like my experience has been diminished  i can t even imagine how crippled future desktop users will be ,-0.188
perhaps it is opinion  but considering the idea of this sub is to change my view  and most people agree with my view explicitly and try to play da  there is something wrong with this   saying it is just my problem doesn t change my view ,-0.104
you should post your problem to  r redesign  it is the place for everything related to the new design   i haven t heard anyone having the problems you are having  so it is almost certainly related to your system and or the extensions you have installed   edit  i see you are using safari on ios so first of all  don t ever use safari  use chrome instead  that will probably fix your problem ,-0.479
do you honestly think the new modding tools couldn t exist without a visual overhauls ,-0.208
i am baffled how you originally stated your view as  old reddit is in every way conceivable superior to new reddit from an end user  and you have appeared immovable  your defenses of your view have focused on your personal experiences  so you are only considering a how one or the other is superior to you or people in situations similar to you  there have been a plethora of explanations how the new reddit has improved the user interface experience for at least some portion of users  which i think you ought to give them at least some credit  ,0.042
i would not say for naught  current reddit is still going to stick around  and a bunch of people are still going to use it  plus  you can already use some of your css in the redesign widgets  and there is supposed to be even more ability to post css over into the redesign in the future ,-0.312
if your argument is that anything good about the new design could be implemented without the bad stuff  i think changing your view would be difficult  ,-0.083
everything you listed  could  have been rolled into the old design but instead we have a situation where we have to take the shit to get the qol improvements ,0.125
yes  it probably could have  however  i would put a lot of money down on it being a lot more difficult to implement  taking a lot longer to arrive  and some of the solutions being more of a workaround than if they were built in from the start   for admins  it is a two birds with one stone situation  update mod tools and make the site more user friendly to new people and mods   also  it still is in beta  if there is something you don t like  post it to redesign with why you don t like it and how you think it should be changed  if you have followed the redesign from the start  there have been a lot of big and small improvements that come from redditors providing feedback  it is come a long way and it still has a ways to go  but i feel optimistic  ,0.0
when giving feedback  it is usually ill advised to just go  it doesn t work   because it forces us to come back and ask to further explain your issue   i have no idea what you mean by  not being able to scroll   or  expand  or  comment   scroll where  scroll how  what happens  expand what ,-0.17
  from a modding perspective   lol  you are clearly not actually a very active mod  most mods are pissed about them gutting css  even now  every sub looks better with css than without it ,0.125
it is bad from the perspective of a current reddit user   but you aren t going away   it s good from the perspective of a facebook user  which might transition to reddit     you are not going away  the redesign is to get new users  so   bad from an end user perspective  depends on which end users you are talking about ,-0.25

luckily i wasnt that heavily invested in reddit before the redesign  but i do agree  for being a  better  design it somehow pulled of being a worse design  not just visually but the functions and features aswell   say i wanna copy a text  nope that closes that persons comment  say i want to read the entire thread i was replying to reading  nope that opens up all comments on that post  say i want to use different text formating   i have to google what does what  unless i know it by heart  and theres no way to look it up or change it on the fly   maybe im wrong  maybe im right  im relatively new to the entirety of reddit ,-0.062

not sure what the problem you are having is  but it works pretty well for most people  i can scroll  comment  expand  and most of the stuff i do on old reddit  plus  it looks nicer   now there is still a bunch of stuff that is broken or hasn t been implemented yet  i do hope they fix those things  but your experience is not what most people experience with the new redesign  ,-0.104
no  it looks like shit and you can t see the images without clicking and there is not a light theme  i get that there are flaws in the redesign  but why does nobody complain about the shit that is the old design ,0.625
how does one describe an end user on a site such as reddit ,-0.458
i feel the same way about the new imgur that still doesnt have drag and drop implemented  ,-0.271
the redesign makes reddit easier to use for luddites  therefore increasing appeal for existing social media users who may have previously found reddit  too retro  to navigate and understand    this redesign serves only to increase the user base of reddit  and therefore increase profit generated    it is as simple as that  you guys are overthinking it  ,0.042
you don t seem like someone who is capable of having their views changed  this discussion can only be about whether there are any upsides to the overhaul  we can t convince you that the aesthetics that you hate are actually good  ,0.021
one major advantage that people miss is that reddit is now a full fledged web app  this serves a lot of advantages  i believe the move was fuelled by the  possible  fact that a lot of reddit s userbase comes from various mobile apps   you might have noticed that none of the internal links refresh the page  but instead fetches you information in an instantly loaded new view  as is the expected behaviour in a mobile app   also  given that you use a popular updated browser  your browser will cache all the views for you making reddit even faster  and the fact that they now have proper design guidelines and brand identity is arguably a good thing  and finally  their code is now sweet af  if you try you can smell it  ,-0.271
it is more ridiculous that the  opt out of redesign   button constantly gives an error ,-0.312
but it seems like they are eventually planning on adding it back  no  so this complaint should not be permanent ,-0.458
nope  they have made it very clear since the start that css will be gutted from the new design  they have stated that there might be some css options  but not real css like we have always had  i have been a mod  on multiple accounts for ten years now and i know a lot of long term mods  no one is happy about this ,-0.208
exactly  sounds like this user is just having bugs on likely his old iphone and doesn t want to explain them  ,-0.152

i want to gold this post but that would mean paying reddit for a mistake   uhm  as far as changing your view  it is for the normies  they don t care about freedom and power in the user interface as much and just want an easy time with a more basic level of engagement  maybe it is a greater detriment if the power users all hate the redesign  i d hope so  but it looks like reddit s purpose is no longer aligned with yours ,-0.021
have you tried the classic view  it is like old reddit but if you click to go to the comments  it opens inline so you don t have to open a bunch of tabs  or is your question related solely to the card view ,-0.277
what i was expecting with the redesign was purely a change of color scheme to orange  and maybe some of the boxes graphics have differently shaped contours gradients   however i was fully expecting everything to remain in pretty much the same place  i really would not have been opposed it  i actually like the orange color scheme over blue  not that it would matter for night mode  ,-0.417
you do realize that other users can scroll  right  i can scroll on every page  which seems to make your biggest argument sort of invalid,-0.042
they did it to increase ad revenue  the goal is to keep you on reddit as much as possible  before the redesign  when you clicked a link it would take you to the hosting site  imgur  gfycat  and reddit would lost that ad revenue  now  a lot of these links are opened within reddit which gives to ad revenue back to reddit   i hate the redesign  but it makes sense why they did it  they were driving traffic away from reddit and to other sites for a long time  user experience is just an afterthought ,-0.042
am i the only person on earth that thinks the redesign is actually kind of refreshing and nice  ,-0.348
with the sheer amount of content the site has  it is probably really fuck expensive to run it  ,0.438

the awful truth is that both parties pretty much just keep the status quo on most issues but complain when the other party is doing it  look at partisan support for  fighting crime   for example  it s always a problem when the folks across the aisle are pumping money into precincts  but you will not find a major candidate saying that he or she is going to crack down on cops    that said   nothing to offer  is probably a bit harsh  libertarians tend to run in right wing circles more than left wing ones  so the chances of creating a libertarian base within the republican party is better than with the democrats  and libertarians aren t going to be able to compete as their own party  ,-0.042
you should make a distinction between the party and the candidates  rand paul was a libertarian and a candidate in the primaries    i do agree however that most of the candidates do not abide by the libertarian principles but there are still quite a lot of good candidates with strong libertarian principles ,-0.333
i agree with your first paragraph wholeheartedly  however  in this past year i have seen  what i see  as many opportunities to pass bipartisan legislation for things such as daca that the republicans have refused to move on  then some of their major agenda items are to build a wall and increase tariffs  and  to top it all off  i am still hearing republicans arguing against lgbt issues and marijuana legalization  i don t see a pro liberty agenda ,-0.021
but is there a distinction between the two  can t i judge the party based on who they elect  and while i do agree with rand paul often  he seems to be a black sheep in the gop ,-0.062
i believe it is the voters who are to be judged on who they elect  the republican party provides a platform to libertarians  however  the voters do not resonate with the libertarian values  mainly due to religion    the fact that the republican party provides a platform to libertarians is a reason why in my opinion it is much better than the democratic party ,0.0
keep in mind that this administration is       weird    also keep in mind that one big issue with the legislative process is how bills will get unrelated things put in as  at best  compromise within the legislature or  at worst  as simple pork barreling  if you have control over both houses  you don t need to play that game and can just pass whatever the party agrees to without worrying about your opponents getting some of their issues in as well    and it is not as though the previous democratic congresses were terribly willing to compromise either    that said  the left right now  is  very much the party for certain civil liberties  ,-0.062

i believe that in the future  libertarian views will become more prominent in the party  the only ones opposing personal liberty  eg  gay marriage  etc  are the religious core of the party  this religious and anti personal liberty group consitute mainly of old people   the younger generation are much more open on social issues and the main reason for them to like the republican party is its fiscal views  as this younger generation replaces the older one  the republican party will have no other choice but to adopt more libertarian views ,-0.021
what i am doubting right now is whether this administration is abnormal  or if it is the true face of the republicans and all that talk about liberty was empty  like i have been saying  economic liberty and nothing else   and what confuses me is that most people support the majority those of civil liberties  even most republicans voters support marijuana decriminalization  so the lawmakers could pass a law like that with very little blowback  and nearly everyone supports offering protection to the dreamers ,0.062
  even most republicans voters support marijuana decriminalization  so the lawmakers could pass a law like that with very little blowback   the people who end up voting  especially in things like primaries  are  very  different than the overall public  and the people who don t go to the ballot boxes really don t matter to politicians     i m doubting right now is whether this administration is abnormal  that s an entirely different topic  but it was not really what i was getting at  the party  as it is now  is not terribly amenable to your views  however  people like you tend to be on the right more than on the left  at least in recent memory  so creating a more libertarian voter base would be easier on the right than on the left  ,-0.146

they are big on gun liberty which i think is overrated  i am with you though as a libertarian who used to vote republican  they are pretty much a garbage party imo  they are  lowering taxes  are basically just megacorp handouts in the form of borrowing  i want conservative economic spending as a libertarian  both parties light lots of money on fire  but if i have to spend money  i would rather it be for poor people and general safety nets rather than for wars and megacorps  plus dems are actually generally sane when it comes to social rights that actually don t cost anything ,0.083
how is fighting for the free market nothing to offer you    how is fighting for people to work on themselves and not be a burden on society nothing to offer to libertarian   the democrats are fighting for socialism lately and socialist values that literally are anti you if you are a libertarian    they literally said they like socialism more than capitalist in a recent gallup poll   their representatives say that alexandria ocasio cortez who is a socialist is the future of the party ,0.25
gun rights  as a libertarian  the 2nd amendment and its protections are something you should be concerned with  of the two major parties  the republicans offer the most  the democrats off  nothing  when it comes to gun rights  and honestly the stated goal is the outright ban of all private ownership of firearms  i believe that is something the republicans offer  scotus cases prove this   ,0.13
i am also a libertarian  and am currently registered as a republican  while i agree that the majority of the party no longer shares my interest  the republican party has a liberty caucus  which holds my view closer than any major party  the reason i still justify being a republican on paper is to vote those caucus members in to try and help reshape the party to being pro liberty again   don t worry about the whole party  the liberty caucus is the best place for liberty in america  ,0.021
 i am a conservative but do not consider myself a republican  the  soft  democrats have been forced out of their party by the ultra left nut jobs and have invaded the republican party making it a moderate democratic party  leaving conservatives  once considered republicans  without a party  would i ever go over to the democrat side  of course not  republicans are still closer to the libertarian viewpoint then democrats could ever be  so when it comes to voting you and i are stuck voting for a ultra left nutcase or a democrat  ,0.146

if the republicans offered anything to libertarians  there would be no need for a libertarian party  the reason it exists is because we see both major parties as inherently flawed and bad for the us  just look at the last election  we had a choice between a detached narcisisst  and a bought and paid for shill  the sad part  you don t quite know who i am referencing in either case    the very existance of the libertarian party  and the fact it had the success it did in the last election  shows that neither major party offers anything of merit to the libertarians  ,0.13

the republican party has largely gotten rid of earmarks  one big component of pork barrel spending  a lot of people think this is a good thing but in practice it has made the party much worse at governing  the reason is that to govern well you need to sometimes pass legislation that does good things but might have poor optics or otherwise expose a lawmaker to attack  either from the opposition party or from a primary challenger  earmarks used to be the way to get reluctant lawmakers on board  since they have been done away with there is nothing you can give someone in that situation and the only politically smart thing to do for legislators in swingy districts or with strong primary challengers is to say no to any such legislation  so tough bills just don t get passed anymore ,-0.083

as a fellow libertarian  the gop is still going to be the lesser of the two evils for me  i am much more concerned about the economic and constitutional aspects of libertarianism than the social issues aspect  partly due to the cramming down the throat way the left has started going about things    that being said the republicans suck and i dread my dream of them and the democrats being dismantled will not happen in my lifetime ,-0.062
i would actually argue that the republican party today already caters much more towards libertarians than it does conservatives  the leftwing  not all democrats  but they are clearly moving quickly in that direction  is collectivist  so republicans are ultimately going to allow you more room to have a say in policy  if progressivism wins well  look at europe  american style individualism is a beautiful and rare thing  if you believe in freedom of association  the right to raise your children as you see fit  free speech  religious   cognitive freedom  gun ownership  and the ability for an individual to create his own destiny  the republican party is the better match for your values than the democrats ,0.021
this may be purely anecdotal on my part and i admittedly don t have stats to back this claim up  but i feel based on my experience that most young people lean democratic  and the ones that are republican are either very religious or have embraced the alt right platform  there are very very few young republicans who abide by the social freedom platforms  they are almost all against gay marriage and immigration reform  they want to ban both  ,0.146
this entire concept of the republican party having adopted libertarians always bugged me  socially speaking  republicans have always been adamant on their conservative social values  the social platform of the libertarians is much closer to liberalism than conservatism  would not it make more sense for the libertarian base to become a  free agent  so to speak and sign with the dems  who are less willing to part with their social platform but more open to economic ideas    you really will not ever get what you are looking for from either party  i guess it is just a matter of what sector you value more  ,-0.042

i honestly think it is a difficult distinction to establish what specific are of value foreign correspondence with traditional libertarian guidelines   i think the trump republican party is different from the traditional gop and that is more centrist republican party   obviously there are also very libertarian people like rand paul but that is not the norm in the gop   my main argument for the current republican party is protecting free speech which is under serious attack  they are also pushing for less government not more   so perhaps that may be a strong enough reason to help you   politics are crazy and i personally think the whole country was run by a uniparty for the last 50 years ,-0.042

you will find there is a wide variety of beliefs among libertarians  some closer to anarchists  but most are more pragmatic  in the us you will likely find most libertarians to want limited federal government  leaning towards the rights of states to make their own laws  most still believe the federal government should have key responsibilities like national defense  the justice system  state department  etc ,-0.229
i agree with your assessment  but i think you are mistaken about spiderbro   specifically  a big reason that sub is popular is that siders are everywhere and mostly  easy to photograph  i do not think it is indicative of any relative arthropod preferences ,-0.396
a large reason as to why spiderbros are spiderbros is because a lot of them hang around where humans are and typically stay in just one spot where they chill and hunt for pray   as far dragonflies  i am not so sure  afaik  they typically live in places with stagnant water  like a pond or a lake  so any place that is dry is out of their protection  also  they buzz around from place to place  which can be annoying while you are just resting and watching a movie  so as to net benefit to humans  i think the dragonflies superiority to spiders is disputable  but as for abilities and beauty  i would have to agree with you ,-0.319
dragonflies do not often live indoors and protect peoples houses from flying ass hole s and so lack a major part of a spider s  dopeness ,0.083

definitely  chillness should be a variable  i would very much like a spider that chills and keeps to its own in one place  than a spider skittering around hunting for prey and sometimes crawling on my face  that would not be dope at all   like i said  dragonflies have less range  they live near stagnant waters and generally aren t indoors  so that means they benefit less humans compared to spiders  who can bunker down in a dry house  also  dragonflies buzz around  which can disturb you much like a roaming spider when you are resting or being inactive  but a web spider entrenches itself in one place  you know it is there  you know it is deadly to bugs you don t like  and you know it is not going anywhere else and hence it is not going to hurt you  ,-0.083

i will agree with you that dragonflies are more awesome   while spiders are more chill and can bro out in your living room and not bother anyone  dragonflies will buzz around all over the places  catching any and all flying insects  then eating them alive while still hunting for other  lesser bugs   plus  larval dragonflies also eat basically any living thing it can catch  small fish  lunch  tadpoles and small frogs  dinner and dessert  mosquito larvae  light snack before lunch   while dragonflies might not be as dope  they are  100 more metal   also a fun dragonfly fact  they are some of the most effective active predators in the world  catching nearly all    95  prey items they pursue ,-0.25

while i also thing dragonflies are fuck dope  the problem is you cannot really keep them at home  it would be very hard  and possibly cruel to the little beasties  since they need much space to fly and be happy  and hunt by aerial strikes     spiderbros meanwhile are ambush predators  and can patiently wait in their designated spot for their prey     spiders also eat a lot of bugs that a dragonfly cannot catch  like pillbugs  centipedes  roaches  etc  a dragonfly can only catch flying insects  or crawling insects if they are clearly in the open  it cannot crawl under the couch to grab a roach and drag it out for the kill     for maximum anti pest coverage  you need a solid team of spider infantry at home  plus a cadre of dragonflies living outside to intercept hostiles ,0.167
an additional plus for dragonflies    a dragonfly knows to stay away  a spider  on the other hand  will move into your house and crawl across your face at night  it will also try to create more spiders in your house  a bug that is smart enough to not touch people is a bug that people don t need to fear   fear of bugs that don t bite can be stronger than fear of bugs that can actually cause harm  i would much rather see a spider than a roach   a dragonfly doesn t ruin any occasion  because it stays away  i am not sure i can say that about any other bug ,0.0

why is it just those terms then  do you hold the same view for everyone who makes fun of someone else regardless of what they are saying ,-0.333
 why is it just those terms then   because they are very specific insults that are usually used by a very specific subset of people  incels  red pillers and such     do you hold the same view for everyone who makes fun of someone else regardless of what they are saying   i just don t understand why you would make fun of someone just because they aren t trying their best to be as masculine as possible   like if i were to see an unmasculine or effeminate guy i would not get any reaction  but something triggers them to shout  cuck  over and over and the only explanation that comes to my mind is that it is because they get reminded of their own insecurities  ,0.083
i guess what view do you want changed then  you admit that people can use the term and not be considered insecure in their masculinity     you have pointed out that instead  insecure people who use those terms and in fact insecure     shouldn t it be the case where anyone who uses the term is insecure  because you are not a psychic and you do not know their true motivations  ,0.083

some spiders can walk on water like our lord and savior  and at one stage in their life  the very beginning  like from charlotte s web   they can fly  many of them can burrow  the most awesome part about spiders though is that they can hide so well  they become  invisible   dragonflies are so erratic that they couldn t dream of the power of invisibility  ,-0.042
let s say you didn t like predator era arnold schwarzenegger  would you call him a soy boy  probably not because it would not make sense  i agree with you in the statement that insults don t have to have deeper meaning  but i think you are incorrect in the claim that insults such as soy boy are randomly chosen  ,0.125

sure i could   predator era arnold is a soyboy cuck   done   i could throw in any other insult there and it would have equal weight to me ,0.25
the insult is directed at someone else  so it doesn t matter what weight it has on the one delivering the insult  it matters much more on how the receiver weighs the insult  after all  if the reciever and the audience do not give much weight to the insult  then what was the point   an alternative counterpoint  you say that the insult you use is irrelevant to you  so then why not use a less politically controversial insult   ass hole   douchebag  mother fuck etc    you would get the same self satisfaction  while avoiding unnecessary confrontation from people who interpret your insult as political  why burden yourself with such situations  ,0.277

 i could choose from a bunch of words but i randomly picked soy boy for this instance  thats as deep as it goes when i call someone it   but does it happen randomly  that is what i don t believe    if i use an insult it is because i assume that it hurts the other or that i think it is something bad   when i hear  soy boy  i don t feel hurt  all i feel is that this person must think that an attack on someone s masculinity hurts others as much as it would hurt them  ,0.111
all you are saying here is that you don t know why you are choosing that word  which somewhat supports the op s point that people using those words don t understand their own motivations or what they are saying about themselves ,-0.104
is not the question regarding the character delivering the insults and not how it is received  i feel like your point just strengthens mine further that it is possible to insult and have it mean nothing   the op asked specifically about soyboy and cuck not other words  im addressing his argument and not another one but i will explain  if the insult someone hypothetically uses means nothing why would they bother to use discretion in selecting a specific insult  like what ,0.312

when someone attacks you verbally by using a name to put you into a group  they are doing it to make you feel bad  and to make them feel good   you have no control over them feeling good  if it makes them happy to call you names  then so be it  you could realise that they have a sad little life where they judge how happy they are by how unhappy they make you feel  and then you could feel sorry for them   or you could decide to be offended by what they think  but you already don t care what they think   so then we are left with  is what they say true  if it is true  then you can care or not care  that is all that is under your control ,0.0

i think it makes you fell better to imagine that anybody who calls you names is insecure  some people might be insecure and take it out on others through insults sure  but there are also those who insult others because they do not like them  or because they think its amusing  or because they are parroting what they hear others say as a joke   your making a big assumption  suggesting that a majority of people who insult you are insecure  and you have nothing to back it up with  i can t prove you wrong  but i can tell you that your assumption is not substantive  people are complicated and do thing for a large variety of reasons  you will not always know why people say what they say  sometimes they haven t even analyzed it themselves ,0.104

i don t think you can argue this very well  because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt  but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical  for this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral ethical  so they will always make equal or better than the moral person  i think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally  ,-0.229
hi  thanks for the reply  but yes  that is what i was saying and asking  you are pointing out my wrong debatable phrasing  but not addressing my view ,-0.312
have you read the book  the giving tree   you cant be too generous   a boss that pays salaries needs to be able to afford these salaries  a company needs to be profitable to afford salaries  and for that  every cog in that wheel needs to be important   your boss cant do it alone  thats why he has help  and in order to get the best help  you need your employees to have a high moral and be loyal   you cant have loyal happy workers if you treat and pay em like shit   they will just leave  ,0.0
yes  i agree  and i understand  i am not saying a boss should pay his employees as much as he is earning  take two bosses  both of which are making enough to live comfortably  but one boss pays someone slightly above minimal wage  and another pays very well   in this scenario  the boss with  less morals  earns more  but not necessarily mistreating ,-0.085
take these 2 bosses you just mentioned  the boss paying just above the minimum will have a disgruntled employee who half the time thinks about how she closes this month  and will bail the first chance s he gets at a better job   finding good  loyal people is hard  my boss talks about the tech industry being a  golden cage   they pay big salaries  have a lot of benefits  and make it nearly impossible for a person to leave  he is chained to his lavish life style   and you know why  cause happy workers who dont need to worry about money  or any other thing  can stay focused on work  and well payed workers that have a hefty mortgage on a nice house  wont risk leaving   my point is   google  and  intel  would not have happened with slave labor ,0.174
but it is not that the lower paid employee is underpaid  what is one employee is paid decently  but has financial troubles at home  the boss knows it  but does not do anything about it  then  another employee that is paid the same  also has financial troubles at home  and that boss decides to help out by giving the employee money   in this case  the boss that has higher  morals   is kinder  will make less money than the former boss ,-0.146
that question is not very easy to answer either imo   does acting immoral include faking moral actions  is there a difference between your point of an immorally acting person having the option to act morally and the option to fake acting morally  how do you tell the difference  i think immorally acting people always have the upper hand compared to people acting within any belief moral guidelines  simply because if a moral action would benefit them  they would just fake that action    ,-0.125
if the boss believes he is paying a fair wage  he should not feel responsible for his employee s financial trouble  since the employee s life is private  the boss can t know he is to blame for their trouble  if your employee has gambling trouble and goes into debt  paying him out is awful  look  your work  his work  its all business  you are selling your time and service for the fee he offers  this is why you sign a contract  and that contract specifies the relation you have with your boss  he doesnt have to hire you  you dont have to agree to work there  but once you sign the contract  each of you agrees willingly to the other s terms  ,-0.128

you have created a logical loop that can only be answered your way    of course you would be better off financially paying an employee 1 cent less  participating in all activities than a select few would make you more money  i think another commenter made the point that you would be able to participate in things longer if they were moral legal than illegal  but ascribing moral behavior based on monetary gain eludes the other circumstances that lead to that choice being made ,0.0

depends on any factors  take company size  small companies rely on relationships  so morals are important  large companies thrive on growing margins  by doing whatever is necessary  a fundamental part of growing a company is distance between management and customer  as this grows  perceptions change to a more immoral view  it also depends highly on whether society has morals or not  some countries don t value law while some cherish it  in the end you will be more financially successful with less ethics  taken at a global macro level  simply looking at overall population and where more financial growth is occurring and in what fields ,-0.083

i think this is true  i think you are right  morality and ethics are restraints  people can better achieve their goals if they use a strictly rational strategy  for one instance  i am surprised that so few women engage in sex work  there is a lot of money in sex work  an average looking woman can easily earn  50 0 per year untaxed    however  many people are unable to function without moral principles  many women  could  engage in sex work  but most women have personal values which would cause them too much cognitive dissonance if they were to engage in sex work    likewise  many people are mentally incapable of discarding their moral principles for money ,0.25
i dont think this is an opinion  this is a fact that can t be changed  yes  doing the bare minimum for your employees will make you money  because anything extra is just that  extra  not legally required  therefore not as efficient  any way you can game the system or do only what is required of you will make you more money  is it right  hell no  is it smart  absolutely ,0.128

  marshmallows are disgusting    whipped cream is consistent with the base of the hot chocolate so it does not change the core of the drink when added   hot chocolate is made with milk as is whipped cream     marshmallows add a texture that is not necessary for the enjoyment of hot chocolate whereas whipped cream more seamlessly blends in    marshmallows are really disgusting   edit   not ,-0.271
marshmallows being disgusting is entirely a point of taste  i happen to love them ,-0.438
marshmallow superiority is highly dependent on taste too so the entire premise is a wash ,-0.479
you will notice none of my reasons related to taste  i also love whipped cream  but the practical aspects of using marshmallows over whipped cream make them superior ,-0.167
the same practical aspects could apply to something like tomato paste but that clearly does not taste good in a hot chocolate so clearly the taste is important    i could create a non spoiling  perfectly measurable  soluble supper additive that has no taste and we would not be arguing about its superiority ,-0.196
the practical aspects of using water over marshmallows makes water far superior     water is more available  many times people are preparing hot chocolate somewhere with water  whereas marshmallow availability may be limited     water immediately mixes into the hot chocolate  marshmallows will sit on top until they melt  which takes far longer  at which point your hot chocolate is  at best  warm chocolate     it is easier to measure the amount of water used rather than the amount of marshmallow ,-0.271
note  hot chocolate is not universally made with milk and the contention of a consistent base is therefore flawed ,-0.333
as op has stated  they like the taste of both whipped cream and marshmallows so taste of additive is not relevant for this cmv  stop changing the basis of the argument  this is simply whipped cream vs  marshmallows for practical addition to hot chocolate  ,-0.438
water is irrelevant to the discussion  the products to be compared are marshmallows and whipped cream  not marshmallows and water or whipped cream and water  ,-0.354
i would agree with you except for one thing  the argument seems to be that marshmallows and whipped cream are similarly delicious hot chocolate toppings and so the availability of marshmallows makes gives them the edge  however  water and marshmallows are not similarly delicious hot chocolate toppings ,-0.292
no  no  no  because his viewpoint comes from a position of loving the flavor of both  so assuming neither is superior in flavor  he posits that marshmallows are superior overall     therefore  to refute his specific view  you must argue under the assumption that both are equal in flavor  you attempt to undermine the premise of his argument  which nullifies the whole discussion  and does not in the end  change his view      also p s  marshmallows are clearly superior ,-0.167
marshmallows get more disgusting when you start thinking about what is in them boiled animal cartilage is not exactly appetizing   also  presenting the false dichotomy between marshmallows and whipped cream completely disregards the best thing to add to hot chocolate peppermint schnapps ,-0.292

i think you are missing the point of this cmv  look back at the title of the post  this is for discussion of whipped cream vs  marshmallows  nothing else  ,-0.447
what if the premise is ultimately flawed though  i can say which is better apples or oranges then say the measurement of  betterness  is based on redness but that is not a useful premise  ,-0.333
i do not see how i am answering anything but that   these factors are all entirely subjective and to claim superiority seems impossible  you can only do so by constraining the valuation to a set of characteristics at which point i think the whole argument is meaningless ,0.0
if you think the argument is meaningless then why engage in it  especially when your opinion is obviously biased by the fact that you don t like marshmallows   people who enjoy both can have an objective discussion about the merits and pitfalls of each  when you chime in and immediately say marshmallows are disgusting then you are obviously making only a subjective argument and thus your argument is meaningless  not the argument on whole  ,0.146

i would only argue that whip cream makes for a better presentation ,-0.521
while whipped cream may take longer to dissolve  it provides significant benefits even before it dissolved by bringing the temperature of the beverage down from  will burn your tongue  to  hot but drinkable   as evidence i present starbucks hot lattes  with whip  i can begin drinking immediately with minimal risk of burning  however without whip i will inevitably burn my tongue due to a lack of patience  this instant drinkability allows you to consume the hot cocoa while it is still hot without burning yourself  therefore it is clearly superior  in addition  using whipped cream from a can gives you the added opportunity to take a shot of straight whipped cream which is significantly more enjoyable than a couple of extra marshmallows  seeing as the marshmallows that one would use for hot cocoa are generally lower quality ,-0.375
whipped cream is so much more versatile when it comes to flavoring  if you make it yourself you can add  coffee syrup  bourbon  maple syrup  orange zest  vanilla  dark rum  smore shnops  or whatever flavors you want to add  with marshmallows you get marshmallow flavor and that is it    regardless  of the arguments presented here  including mine  i am going to challenge your premise that there is a best hot chocolate topper that works for everyone  that is a bull shit premise  it is your hot chocolate  put whatever the hell you want into it  and let other people have their hot chocolate however they want it  to each their own  but don t be afraid to try out someone else s way just in case they are on to something ,-0.062

wrong    i always get hot chocolate from starbucks  and from there you have two options     mix the whipped cream with the hot chocolate to cool it down   or drink all of the hot chocolate and enjoy cold whipped cream at the bottom    marshmallows suck because cold  sweet whipped cream taste so much better than marshmallows and you can t drink marshmallows with a straw  ,-0.304
if you get distracted for some reason  urgent phone call  sudden house fire  etc   you end up either with a soggy disgusting marshmallow  or creamy warm chocolate  which is still quite nice,-0.5
false  marshmallows are disgusting  and you can t down a cocoa without those tiny snowman dick going to town on your esophagus    whipped cream is smooth  adds better flavor  and you can add tons,0.362
i think the key word you used was eventually  eventually the marshmallow will melt  i will be long done with my hot chocolate by the time it even gets softened  maybe as an after drink treat but then you missed out on the cream and chocolate mix  plus whipped cream has basically 3 ingredients if you make it at home  cream  powdered sugar and a bit of vanilla  whereas marshmallow has about half a dozen or more  some  once you learn where it comes from  you might not want in your drink  ,-0.146

any chance of suffering is inhumane  like leaving a dog in a car  the animal might only have a chance of dying a painful death but it is a risk not worth taking so you can just nip out   not to mention the reason for the suffering being created is simple appearance  if you take a look at how dogs used to be for example the english bull terrier  bred to bait bulls it needed to be strong and healthy  when the purpose for thay animal  bull bating  became obsolete rich people began breeding to created strange animals with unusual features like a curved skull  not to mention these changed occurred so quickly the animals genes couldn t correct them selves    preventing suffering is better than ending suffering  ,0.0
   any chance   of suffering is inhumane  in that case  it is extraordinarily important to define  generally  not just for this conversation  what  suffering  is  yes   being maimed  being substantially impoverished  being depressed    these are all things people often believe are classified as suffering  but when you are having children or deciding to let your guinea pigs procreate  you really need a clear definition if you are going to have your belief ,0.042

   most of you believe that anything that can further human population is good and or moral  even when it is detrimental to the rest of earth     there is a split among you about how we should treat animals  the line is blurry for most everyone in the thread     weirdo dog breeding has made some really disturbing traits in dogs and cats  animals suffer and live awful lives because  cute   i am not an animal rights guy  but how this get a overlooked all the time is bizarre to me     this thread has delved into some great discussions and i have appreciated that    ,0.062

every living thing everywhere has a  genetic defect   right now  you have at least one half of a gene that  if activated in your children  would lead to disastrous results  if you have a kid with someone  they also put in that kid s genetic code at least half of at least one disease that you would never want to have  it is only when the genes are  active  that we see the disease  this is why inbreeding is so dangerous  and why homogeneous ethnic groups are at great risk for some diseases and at lower risk for others  if you want to ban selectively breeding based on this  you would have to ban all breeding in general ,0.104

  fairly well documented adage that married men receive less frequent exciting sex over the length of a marriage   source     the wife in question should be tasked with finding a suitable sexual replacement for her husband    does she have to perform the finding or can she just allow it and let him do his thing   why can t the man be responsible for determining what he accepts in a relationship  if he is not happy with the situation don t get married  or if already married get divorced ,0.167
if he can t please his wife how can he please his mistress ,0.065
  source   most married men i interact with     does she have to perform the finding or can she just allow it and let him do his thing     why can t the man be responsible for determining what he accepts in a relationship  if he is not happy with the situation don t get married  or if already married get divorced   she doesn t have to  but i believe that would be the more healthy thing to do for the relationship  sometimes you are emotionally happy with the person you are with  but they are not interested or willing to provide the level of sexual satisfaction that they used to  plus there are families to consider  breaking up a family aka divorce is difficult on children ,0.083
then here is what you are missing  the type of men who are more likely to want an open relationship are less likely to be married  and less likely to stay married  especially to women who don t  allow  it   the type of wives that would allow it  therefore  are not wives  but rather girlfriends  the type of wives that   don t   allow it are wives  because  they don t allow it   in other words   if the wives  wanted  to allow it  why did they get married in the first place   the type of people who get married are the type of people who will not allow an open relationship  generally ,0.106
  most married men i interact with   this is totally anecdotal and not  fairly well documented   then  ,-0.292
i agree with you except that you are leaving out the impact of divorce on a family  we want to be with our wives  but we also want to have the same sex we had with the girlfriend that became our wife  we would rather not have an open relationship  but still want the attention we used to receive ,0.188
true  but your argument then  only covers  those that made an agreement not to cheat  marriage contract   and are now changing their minds   essentially  you are saying people should be allowed to renege on a contract   and if everyone agreed with you  we would have no need for the contracts  marriage  in the first place  what is the point of the contract  then ,-0.042
married men can do whatever they like  they just have to live with the consequences    same for married women  if  let s say  her husband has let himself go and she just doesn t fancy him any more for sex  but he is still useful for putting shelves up   wives do not  allow  husbands to do things  and vice versa  marriage is a partnership  if one side of that partnership is not happy with an aspect of it  they need to discuss it   if one partner  wife or husband  wants to sleep with other people  and the other is ok with it then fine    but it must be agreed by both parties otherwise the  harm  is simply transferred from one party to the other  i would argue it is easier for a man to not have sex than it is for a woman to cope with a cheating husband ,0.104
in his defense the adage is probably well documented  there are lots of movies and books that are based on this  that just does not mean it is a  well documented fact ,-0.188
i think you are overestimating the libido of men over time  the older you get the more responsiblities  lack of free time  tiredness  etc  can you provide any studies to show that a mans libido at the age of 40 is the same as age 22  what about intimacy  do men only care about getting frequent orgasms or is intimacy just as important  ,0.229
 most married men i interact with   research indicates that on average  married couples have more sex than non married couples of the same age and social circumstances  ,-0.239
go get a group of married men together and ask them  i guarantee you will find a large majority ,-0.25
this would still be anecdotal  even if i did so  ,-0.458
 most married men i interact with   you re aware that  well documented  suggests there are actual  like  documents  involved  yes  like papers or studies that show what you are claiming  not just  married men i know say this  ,-0.167
the specificity of your view and motivation are kinda working against you here   couples  married or otherwise  are perfectly free to negotiate whatever arrangements they deem appropriate ,-0.208
my anecdotal world of married couples that i know includes no shortage of married women who aren t sexually fulfilled by their husbands  are they also allowed to cheat  in your view  ,0.042
it is more of it being socially acceptable considering how often it happens  to the point of married people having a conversation that touches upon  why is not this the way it used to be   she he may answer that she he is not interested in doing that anymore  they both realize that a mutually agreed upon third party may be better at satisfying the others needs ,-0.087
it is a common complaint amongst married men  i urge you to talk to a few who are in the 30 50 year old range and find out for yourself  you will come away unsurprised ,-0.125
whether or not you believe it is common has nothing to do with your inaccurate use of the phrase  well documented    in any case  you are aware that anecdotal evidence is not generally considered a good basis for drawing scientific conclusions  yeah  ,-0.167
maybe men should keep up the level of emotional effort and seduction they  advertised  to their wives pre marriage  a lot of my straight girl friends have complained about how the romance went out of the window as the relationship got more serious but their bfs husbands continued to expect the same returns on diminishing  investments  as it were  they begin to feel entitled to what a lot of people view as an expression of care and affection   p s this is a potential problem with gay couples too  libido differences are common because of how people can be different     also  why do you think a weird one sided open relationship would be less bad for kids than a divorce  divorce is better for kids than a situation of potential inequality  ,0.375
but i am only answering to you right now  someone else posted a chart from a study on married sex life  it is pretty right on with how i am presenting it as far as frequency goes  i am sure variety is a bit harder to document ,-0.167
someone posted a study with a chart that shows frequency of married sex  it is not that great  the mean is 2 3 times per month  with extremes of 18  at  not at all  to 6  at  3 4 times month  ,-0.125
what do you mean by  should be allowed to   are you talking about it legally being allowed or are you talking about it being socially acceptable  ,-0.229
i am in my late 30 s and have strong urges to have sex 2 3 times per week  hell  give me an exciting 15 minutes at least a week  and i would rather not orgasm in favor of a longer session  i am not fixated upon orgasm to be satisfied  in fact  i would rather go longer and please my wife partner than ejaculate simply for the sake of doing so  it doesn t always happen that way  but it is the goal ,0.261
i didn t say it was a lot  i said it was more in average than non married couples,-0.354
you need to look farther down to the graph that shows frequency by martial status  it is about the same as people who have never been married  you are only reading the first chart ,-0.125
i agree that there is another side to the story with men not fulfilling their partners needs  some men will argue that this is in response to the diminishing sex life while others cannot make that argument  in my personal experience  i do find that i don t want to give as much emotionally when i am not getting as much physically  as both are of equal importance to each person ,0.125
if this is the case then the husband should then also find the wife a suitable replacement sexually as well     crickets ,0.021

  most married men i interact with         but do you interact with married women closely enough for  them  to spill their hearts out to you  because i do  and i can immediately name 4 married couples in their 50s in which the wife desires sex way more than the husband and the wives complain to each other that their husbands have too low of sex drives and don t put out enough  ,0.0
do you think that you are more likely to achieve this acceptability by stressing that men are the sole beneficiaries of this change and the only reason it should be acceptable is because men want to have more sex  or if you frame it as any partners in a relationship should be able to strike up whatever compromise pleases them for their own reasons ,0.125
part of a happy marriage is always putting more into it than you feel you are getting out of it  have you tried sprucing up  getting her flowers  taking her dancing  maybe it would change things  maybe therapy would be better   if you are really looking for a way to cheat  it might be time to split up  do the right thing  tell her you are incompatible  and end the marriage  don t just cheat  get caught  and make her do the paperwork ,-0.208
i am a married woman who frequently has exciting sex with my husband after 15 years of marriage  am i  enough married women   i am sure there are more out there ,0.042

agreed however i believe if that is what you desire  that should be discussed prior to marriage and i feel that if you  as a guy  cannot fulfill your wife s needs  she should be allowed to fuck other guys     or  here is a huge revelation  how about you never get married and just keep dating  then you avoid all the problems completely     x200b   marriage is not a job  you don t need one to survive ,0.638

   cannot fulfill your wife s needs  she should be allowed to fuck other guys   you are correct in that if the roles were reversed the same opportunity should be allowed     how about you never get married and just keep dating   if i could have predicted the future and found that my current kinky partner would deaden out into a faint shadow of her sexual self  i may have done just that ,0.543
they are in california  the only reason they aren t is if the internship doesn t provide value to the offering company and is simply creating a learning opportunity for the intern  which is a solid reason for them to exist  ,-0.188
first  it should be legal because no one is forced to do an unpaid internship second  the internship qualifies you to do a job like school so there is not a reason why they should pay you if you were needed to be paid they wont accept you for the internship and you would not be able to gain the valueble expirience,-0.042
sadly the alternative is that these firms just eliminate internships all together or reduce the number since they are required to be paid    unpaid internships also are generally limited to saturated fields  engineering interns can make  15  30 hour at many companies because they are extremely in demand and create monetary value even as interns    you pay money to go to class to gain valuable experience  it requires time  money  and commitment  an internship only requires time  by your logic people should also be paid to be in school or at the gym  you are doing it to benefit yourself  if it costs time and money  that is on you  ,-0.021
no one is  forced  to do an unpaid internship  but for many positions  the only way to get the job is to have experience  and the only experience available comes from unpaid internships   there are ways to get loans  grants  or other forms of financial help to pay for school  there is nothing really like that just for internships ,-0.109
this sounds great in theory  but in practice it is not always like this  there are probably rules like that in most states  but the definition of providing value to the company is pretty fuzzy  and employers take advantage of students or other young people that need to get experience to land a job that pays well   i m not saying i agree or disagree with the op  but at the very least i think the rules should be more strict when it comes to determining what can constitute a paid vs  unpaid internship  and the same the goes for exempt vs  non exempt workers  ,0.021
i suppose i should have specified the united states since i don t know how internships work overseas ,-0.229
in australia  there are plenty of unpaid engineering internships  the job market is competitive for new graduates and so employers have a lot of power to extract labour without paying for it by calling it  experience  ,-0.25
also  many universities require their students work an internship before they can graduate  and if the only internships available to you are unpaid ones  well  you are out of luck  ,-0.083
  unpaid internships also are generally limited to   saturated fields   ,-0.333
i am not sure what point you are making  you suggested interns will get paid in engineering  and i made the point that engineering still has unpaid internships   unpaid internships show up wherever the employers can exert enough pressure to get skilled labour without paying for it ,-0.083
you wanna know how you get experience  you get involved in extra curriculars related to your field while still in college  it shows you have initiative and can work in an organization  it is not that hard ,-0.104

   i think the rules should be more strict when it comes to determining what can constitute a paid vs  unpaid internship  and the same the goes for exempt vs  non exempt workers    this is a topic that interests me and i would like to ask since you seem to have an established opinion  do you have specific thoughts or ideas regarding those parameters and how they should change  for the paid vs unpaid internship but particularly for exempt vs non exempt status determinations,0.0

i appreciate your comment because it strikes at the heart of the problem  student loans are the real class barrier ,-0.319
haha happens all the time to me  almost felt wrong to point out someone else s     ,-0.333
if you are in college and have time for extra curriculars  then sure  but if you are paying your way through college while working in an unrelated field  then it is a little more difficult  or if you are going from high school straight to the job market  then that doesn t really work out as well   also  not every field has experience that can be easily gained outside the workplace  so having a job that helps pay the bills  while also giving you experience to help you move forward in your career  is great  having a job that pays you nothing and puts you into more debt   not so great  companies making money off of students struggling to just get a job in their field  not great at all ,-0.083
yea for like 2 3 months and usually during the summer  the requirements usually aren t that stringent and almost anything can qualify as an internship  ,-0.312
i know 3 people who have full time jobs and are a part of fsae  if they can do it  most people could  i am not denying it is hard  hell its hard even just being a full time student  and the previous experience schtik that some jobs have doesn t necessarily mean experience regarding the actual job  they want to see you can work on a team and meet a deadline  what kind of accomplishments did you have  etc   also  if someone doesn t want to find themselves looking at internships that don t pay  maybe they should study a stem field  ,-0.146
people should not be allowed to work for free   of all the things to complain about,-0.062
i don t see how illegalizing internships does anything  wealthy people will be able to easily find an alternative and gain the same experience that costs even more than an internship does  excluding more people    really  how is internship any different from college  you increase future earning potential for a price  the only reason poor people even go to college is with student loans  ,-0.174
well  does an internship not benefit both sides  the employer gets labour that doesn t cost  while the intern gets real world experience in a workplace  even if it does widen the gap it is not totally one sided ,-0.146
  how is someone from a poor background supposed to have any fair chance at these opportunities   you re not  its one of the downsides to capitalism   my daughter got a great job the day after she graduated but only because she did an unpaid internship with that company during her senior year   the back story  there always is one  is that i worked two jobs so she could one day say  she owed it all to hard work and perserverance     ,-0.312
granted  making the privileged worse off doesn t make the needy better off  internships are still better than going in debt going into higher education and often come with perks such as free formal training  a degree  free accomodation etc   we need more internships  paid or not so that companies actually compete over interns  thus driving up the quality of these programmes  ,-0.25
i did an internship my last semester at college with 0 connections  i barely worked at said internship  i built a webpage to an already existing site    it stuffed my resume  it felt like a class that actually worked towards getting me a job later  i dig your passion  but there is other battles to fight  everyone i knew that took on an internship did not put in 40hrs of free work towards said internship  everyone understands adults have bills to pay  you take on an internship like you take on a college class ,-0.333
done two unpaid internships which didn t really have any promise of work now  they basically dried all my funds up and i had to move back home  the worst part is its also incredibly hard to get them to give you a reference as your being unpaid    currently working in a supermarket and hoping a recruitment agency of some kind values the internship experience  as so far only companies who run unpaid internships are interested in my previous experience  it is kind of hard to progress ,-0.167
the inequality in this country  especially that of wealth and class disparity  is not solvable by restricting a person s ability to make the free decision to be an unpaid intern  the solution you seek to the problem that  poor people don t make enough money  is to remove another potential revenue stream from them  if you really wanted to fix this problem you should be targeting the government and the corporations that got us in this mess not preventing a young adult from gaining vital experience ,0.255
i agree  internships  especially unpaid ones  are an exploitation of our current system which requires you to have 5 years of experience and a degree for an entry level job that 50 years ago you could have started right out of high school with neither of those things    i feel that the world would be better suited in universally moving to the way trades handle schooling  1 3 of the year spent in class time  2 3 of the year on the job being paid as an apprentice  most people learn more by doing than by studying  and if this system were applied  by the time you are done your schooling  you have an equivalent number of years of experience  serving the same purpose as an internship while also allowing people to live and thrive no matter their original circumstances ,-0.229
yes unpaid internships are exploitative in nature  people should be paid at lest minimum wage to enable them to sustain themselves  because that person is working for you  even if he she is learning he she is still doing at lest some work for you  ,-0.167
this is more of a general comment then me trying to change your view  but in some states unpaid internships are actually illegal  so you are semi right,-0.042
wait  i thought they  were  illegal  i keep seeing lpt where they say internships are legally required to give some kind of payment,-0.083

unpaid colleges benefit the upper class too  should we end colleges ,-0.271
unpaid internships are basically volunteering and so would be almost impossible to distinguish between the two in a court of law ,-0.239
i know someone personally that was a social worker and psychologist in a mid sized city    she would always take 1 unpaid intern per social worker to give them an extra set of hands and to let then gain experience  she would often hire these students when they graduated if they had an opening    they worked on mostly government contracts    the province decided to make unpaid internships illegal    she couldn t afford to pay for the extra help  and now both the students who used to be unpaid interns don t have those spots to get experience and her clients patients don t get the same quality of care    while i agree with your concerns about inequality  i think the benefits outweigh the downsides    i think there is a middle ground where companies above a certain size cannot use unpaid interns  but tbd  ,-0.208
i would like to add that not all unpaid internships are created equal  i had one in college that provided me onsite housing and hence i did have to work weekends  but since i qualified for food stamps i didn t have to make that much extra money to keep my head above water  i learned a ton from the internship  got a few professional trainings paid for  and the recommendations i got helped me get my first federal job and later  a prestigious graduate fellowship  i think that this was an ethical unpaid internship because they made it feasible for the interns to survive unpaid and gave us important opportunities and professional connections that we couldn t have gotten in a typical low paying internship ,-0.167
yeah  that was not my experience  for me  they had to be at least a semester long  and you gave detailed breakdowns each week of what tasks you worked on and how it applied to your major career goals  maybe that was just my major or school  but they were pretty specific and strict  ,-0.191
unpaid internships also give school credit  most interns are students  it suck s  but it is not all worthless  this very semester i had to juggle an internship  a job  and school and i was very tired but i live for these kind of challenges  plus my resume looks good now  it is all about playing the game until you get to the top ,-0.229
the vast majority of people are not  never were  and never will be alcoholics  anyone pressuring someone to drink is doing so under the reasonable assumption that the person being pressured will not be harmed   i think pressuring anyone into doing anything they have declined is generally not good  but pressuring someone to drink is equivalent to pressuring someone who never has into eating shellfish   they could be allergic and be permanently harmed  but it is so unlikely that it is not part of the thought process of the person doing the pressuring or of those morally judging it ,-0.042
sometimes my friends know when i am feeling tense and need a little prodding to let loose  they know if i really don t want to  i will be able to ignore them  but they have totally been correct that on nights where i have been reluctant to drink  i have ended up having an awesome time with them  ,-0.022
doesn t it depend on who and why  for instance  suppose i do know the person well and do know they are not an alcoholic  and suppose furthermore that i know why they are not choosing to drink  calorie counting  desire to go to sleep early today in order to spend time tomorrow with different friends i don t approve of  believe they hate the taste of cider but seriously this cider is actually amazing and not at all what they believe   is it really so immoral in those circumstances ,-0.208
alcohol is dangerous and highly addictive regardless of what the intent is for drinking   not drinking  you are pushing them to consume what could be the most harmful substance in existence   would you offer your friend a cigarette  you likely would not even offer one but you for sure should not push it  that is probably because you recognize that there is no benefit to smoking  that smoking is addictive and you would not want to be part of the reason why someone got addicted to it  if you know of an amazing cider  then that sounds like the perfect gateway to developing an addiction to alcohol ,0.062
to be honest it is unfortunate that you thought you had to drink with your friends in order to enjoy your time with them  if we broke down the details  we would likely find that the reasons you enjoyed yourself were quite separate from the fact that you drank a depressant that filled your senses and slowed your brain   edit  it is enormously depressing to me that suggesting that you don t need to drink to have fun has earned me  22 karma on this post  no  it is not because i care about internet points  it is because i care that the prevailing attitude is to reject a viewpoint like this ,0.087
 you re pushing them to consume what could be the most harmful substance in existence    that s a bit of an exaggeration  there is like a thousand things you can consume that will just immediately kill you  alcohol is pretty tame by drug standards     shit   i would strongly contend that mountain dew is more dangerous than alcohol  ,0.511
  to be honest it is unfortunate that you thought you had to drink with your friends in order to enjoy your time with them   i didn t think i had to  i don t have to do anything  it was still ultimately my choice  i enjoy myself with my friends in many different contexts  i allowed myself to be convinced to change up the context  and it led to a great night      if we broke down the details  we would likely find that the reasons you enjoyed yourself were quite separate from the fact that you drank a depressant that filled your senses and slowed your brain   actually  no  i definitely enjoyed myself more because the drinks helped me to relax  get a good buzz going  and feel more social energy  reduced anxiety  that is why so many people like to drink  ,-0.125
i would like to hear your argument against mountain dew ,-0.375
it is the most highly caffeinated of the mainstream sodas  and has one of the highest sugar contents as well  which is probably what the commenter above is referring to  ,-0.25
there are a lot more reasons for someone not to drink other than alcoholism  and plenty of them are private or personal choices ,-0.229
you seem to have forgotten the benefits of alcohol   it doesn t only have downside  like any of the drugs that are consumed regularly around the world   what he describes sounds like he was able to get a little bit more comfortable due to the alcohol   that initial boost in comfortableness could very well be what is made it possible for him to have a good evening  sure he likely could have got the same effect through other means but that doesn t make it is a bad thing ,0.021
well  on a personal level  my family has a history of heart disease but no history of liver problems  so for me at least  mountain dew is vastly more dangerous than alcohol  simply because of the calorie count and sugar content  and i realize that certain alcoholic drinks come with the same problem but clear liquor can definitely be argued to be healthier than soda  ,-0.085
i was with you until you said it was the same as a mother hitting a child  a child is physically and emotionally less capable of defending itself against an adult  i don t believe that an alcoholic is less of an adult for struggling with alcohol addiction  i agree that it is a total dick move to pressure anyone to do anything that they don t want to do  but i think that your phrasing and your analogies are so far off the mark that i can t agree with your assertions  alcohol is unhealthy and it is damaging but you are comparing pressuring someone to drink to directly participating in child abuse  those are obviously legally and morally different things in vastly different categories  for this reason i think you are way off base ,0.292
also  we are going to assume the possibility to offer the drink to someone who might relapse  so consumption with a high frequency and high quantity of mountain dew   i actually wonder at this point  if 2l of mountain dew day is worse than a bottle of wine day  ,0.0
honestly  who would pester someone that they don t know well enough to know if they have an alcohol problem to drink  this situation has never come up for me ever  on the other hand family and friends have pestered me at times  i personally don t pester people to anything because it is annoying  yes  you good and well is an addict  should not be pestered to drink  to pester a friend simply doesn t want to drink is annoying but such a big deal ,0.109
while i agree it is annoying to be encouraged to drink when you don t want to  it is also annoying to be a buzzkill  there are some contexts where being the only sober person is not going to be fun and you will bring others down unless you are very good at disinhibiting yourself ,0.277
it is common for ex addicts to view their poison of choice as more harmful because of the associated personal harm they have experienced from it    i do agree somewhat with your point however  it is somewhat bizarre that such a dangerous drug is viewed so brazenly    two things    1  drinking in moderation is not especially dangerous  there is a very small increase in cancer vascular disease risk    2  alcohol use is far more widespread than any other drug  so the harmful effects are seen far more often    i think you are letting your history cloud your thinking  with all due respect     ,0.0
what about the following scenario  a group of friends go out for dinner  a bottle of wine is ordered for the table  person a is not having any and the following conversation takes place    x200b   person b   would you like a glass of wine    person a   no thank you   person b   are you sure  i really think you would like it   person a  i don t like new zeland reds  i find them too dry   person b   i know  but this one is not dry at all  it is very similar to that merlot from bordeaux we had last week that you absolutely loved    x200b   is person b in this scenario equivalent to a parent beating their child ,-0.043
i think that is on them though  i stopped drinking for like 2 years or so just from health issues and didn t want to risk anything happening  my friends were pretty supportive and i still had a lot of fun going out with them  i drink every now and then in moderation but i don t get judged if i am not drinking  i do agree that it can help and it is really fun to get a few beers with friends after a long week  but it is not always necessary to drink if you go out ,-0.083
i is not trying to change your mind because i will say that thank god someone actually thinks like this  i am currently in high school and i live in a city where many people above the age of 13 or 14 drink every week and some people even every day  they also take drugs like ecstasy and shit   along with the occasional marijuana cigarette  can t tell you how many times people are trying to get me to go to parties where they do this shit   they go with the   it is not that bad     it is just fun    can t wait till i never see those people again  ,0.417

you have mentioned that the particulars of the person or situation don t matter but here is an extreme situation based on sadly common real life events  a person in an abusive relationship was told by their partner that they could not drink or wear certain clothes because they would  embarrass themselves   in this instance  avoiding alcohol with the abused partner  whose normal alcohol intake was previously 1 2 drinks with other individuals who were also recreationally drinking and no solo drinking  would be complicit in engaging with the abusive partner s controlling demands  this is a tricky situation   a morally gray area   where the assumptions underlying the drinking are particularly salient  in this case  offering a sip or one drink may be a fast way to challenge some of the assumptions underlying the refusal as well as model that the abusive partner does not necessarily control others  behaviors  ,0.021
depends on the situation  office party  agreed  someone you barely know  agreed   but it also depends on your culture  the norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting  the host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept  the guest in these situations often wants to drink  but must be polite and first refuse  this is especially true if the guest is a woman  it would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink   so what you see as pestering is  for the host  a social cultural obligation ,0.0

i am a non drinker by choice and all my near dear ones are drinker  i don t drink b cos i don t really like the taste  which i know lot of ppl don t like   but still drink  and secondly  i don t like the fact that i will do something to my self to lose my awareness even by a fraction    i used to fall in trap for request for drinking  and then i realized  while i don t enjoy the drink  everyone else is having their fun to be part of of the fun  i should drink something i like  which in most cases ends up being water or juice  now a days  i give a stare when my close relatives  friends pushes me for a drink and they give up   drinking is not for me  and everyone deserves to be happy in their own way  ,-0.021
so your position would include somebody ordering a round of shots for a group they are out with as  morally reprehensible  because this creates a pressure to drink  i think most people intuitively say a person doing this is being generous trying to get everyone to have a good time   i agree with you that it is wrong to encourage someone to drink when they don t want to is wrong  especially if that person has a problem  but once a person has already decided to drink  i struggle to see gently pushing them to have another for the sake of everyone s fun as evil ,0.083
if someone says  no  in most contexts  it should be respected no matter the reason  if you offer someone a drink  this is fine  but if they say  no  and you continue to pressure them into saying  yes   you are doing a huge injustice  you are coercing them into doing something they said  no  to and this is morally wrong ,-0.125
pressuring someone into drinking alcohol is about as  morally reprehensible  as pressuring someone to engage in possibly risky behaviour  like mountain biking or skiing   or pressuring an overweight person into having desert  you can list all sorts of statistics about the effects of alcohol  but they are about a prevalent as the effects of obesity    also you seem to be having a very hard time separating your personal experience with alcohol and the average experience with alcohol  if you have a problem  it is up to you to manage it  just like it is ultimately up to the overweight person to put the fork down    also  start drinking soda with a lime wedge  people will assume it is a drink and leave you alone  ,-0.062

i am in no way an expert  but i would guess it probably depends on your relative tolerance to alcohol versus caffeine  also  i am not sure if it is fair or not to leave other factors such as drunk driving out of the equation  mountain dew might be worse in a strictly medical sense assuming a constant rate of consumption  but that is not really the whole story  ,-0.196
but don t those factors exist on some level with everything   its not just 2l of mountain dew  its having an uncontrolled unhealty habbit  or one a less serious note  i can easily imagine a succesfull that drinks one bottle wine per day  not so much with 2l of mountain dew ,-0.229
there are certain types of poisoning where the toxin has to be processed by the liver before it begins to do damage  for some toxins  the ethanol in an alcoholic beverage will take precedence and be broken down first  given your body time to clear the more dangerous toxin before it does any damage   i don t think that is quite what you meant  but it is a situation where encouraging people to drink  when there is not anything else on hand  can be a good thing   btw  i explicitly didn t name any toxins for which this works for a reason  if you ever ingest or inhale a chemical that is not explicitly safe for human consumption  go to whatever emergency or poisoning services are available immediately  i repeat  do not try this ,0.188
i know some successful people who drink at least that much sugar and caffeine in energy drinks  so it is not that absurd   or at least  i used to know reasonably successful high school   college students who did that    the point of the externalities is that it is  not  just an  uncontrolled unhealthy habit   in the case of alcohol  it  literally kills people every day   and not just the people with the habit  ,0.146
so what if the average european drinks that early  you do understand that it really fuck with your brain right  realistically speaking the drinking age should be 21 25 minimum  when you are younger your brain is still growing and you are more susceptible to big changes that would be more problematic in the future  also if you start drinking earlier you are more likely to start developing an addiction  also it is illegal  and you are argument that   generally we start drinking at 14  doesn t solve any of those problems right  it is just a sad excuse of blaming your continent and people instead of yourself ,0.25

honestly  i think there is a way to categorize it  but i think psychology as a field just is not there  i think part of the problem is that the top people in that field are extremely ambitious when it comes to categorizing people  but they lack the fundamental knowledge necessary  and are in a sense   jumping the gun   ,-0.104
i honestly think it is just a lack of relations and an easy place to meet to meet other like minded people  i think the problem with psychology is a catch al test and liability issues that prevent the psychologist from being able to make his or her personal opinion  if the boss can listen to conversations and passed patients can be audited  a human will try to make the most  empathetic  choice to thier patients  regardless of the tough love they think the patient needs  ,-0.021
if someone is getting treatment for depression and anxiety from a psychologist  it is a lot of work  usually much of that work is changing bad habits and changing bad thought processes   i suppose if someone got a diagnosis and then refused to get treated and simply used it as an excuse  then you may have a point   but the whole idea of someone going into an office  lying on a questionnaire and then refusing to work with the psychologist to actually improve seems implausible  what is the point of even going in to see a psychologist if you are doing that ,-0.021

i was born with chemical imbalances in my brain  i have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life  the thing that pisses me off the most is when people make depression and anxiety their personality  it is the only thing they ever talk about and it defines them  it also makes me incredibly mad when people don t want to help themselves  i have had friends throw away their prescriptions because  they don t work  when they were still staying up all night  eating unhealthy  not exercising  and doing other drugs  depression and anxiety is a sickness that can be treated  our societies romanticizing of it is sickening to me  yes you should not try and suppress your feelings  but you also should not expect everyone to care  it is a personal problem and a personal sickness that nearly everyone has the power to fix  stop the pity party  ,0.021

what sort of help does a lazy person need though  laziness is laziness  it is certainly not depression   i think that is what op is getting at here  s he thinks laziness and depression are completely different things but the lines between them are blurring  why should we accommodate a lazy person the same way we treat a depressed one   depression is a problem  laziness is a shit human trait  imo  treating a lazy person with  compassion and empathy  will only make them shit tier humans    ,0.479
do you call them out on their bull shit though   not to sound mean or anything  but i think i will agree with op and say that depression and anxiety are becoming a cultural thing and seemingly everyone claims they have issues  i have a hard time believing that all these people that claim to have these issues actually have them   i do not doubt for one second that people with these problems exist  they absolutely do  but really  how many people that claim to have these issues actually have them ,0.375
sort of  i mean  we are aware of the stuff that you are saying  it really depends how they are presenting  depression and anxiety exist on a spectrum  so even if people s symptoms aren t consistent with a clinical diagnosis  they can still often benefit from therapy  and their treatment would be adjusted accordingly ,-0.229

in order to claim that this is a trend  you need to provide evidence for it  anecdotes don t sum up to evidence  neither you nor op can possibly know a statistically relevant portion of the american population  and that is even before  confirmation bias    which is something that all humans are prone to    so  what is your evidence ,-0.062

women s and men s multi use bathrooms are separated for safety  it has nothing to do with women being offended at the concept of using a toilet a man has also used  a single use stall would never have that issue   women are concerned about having a man in the women s room because of the worry that a man can easily overpower them in an attack and especially in an enclosed room which is not nearly a concern for men due to strength differences ,0.167
i leave it in the toilet  kind of a dare to do better thing  ,-0.13
i don t disagree with that  though i have additional arguments   but i still feel like you are missing the point of this particular thread  if you  i m assuming male due to context   hop in the line for a single occupancy women s restroom  it is going to be a point of contention ,0.083
i mean does it really have to have anything to do with gender to provide urinals  if you have the right kit  or are brave enough  i don t see anything wrong with providing facilities for a quick 1,0.021
it really would not if there was a reason the men s one is not available  the only way that would he contentious is if there was no line for the men s and a guy decided to stand in line for the women s and make the line longer for no reason ,-0.104
let s try this another way  there is a clearly marked men s room and women s room  single occupancy   there are 4 men and three women in the respective lines  with the understanding that more people will add to the line within the next few minutes because that is how bladders work   are you saying you think it would be smooth sailing if you were to get into the shorter  women s  line  obviously you will get some funny looks at a minimum and even though it is single occupancy  i will wager that your presence will make the women uncomfortable   am i wrong  am i misunderstanding your argument ,0.0
why would we feel uncomfortable with a man just waiting in line  if it is a single person bathroom  there is no risk  you would get some funny looks because that situation would almost never happen  but no woman would flip out as the original poster said  women would only flip out if there was no line for the men s bathroom but a man was waiting in the women s line because it would be holding up their line for no reason as the man could go to his bathroom with zero line  otherwise most people would think it is odd and keep to themselves or ask why they are waiting in the women s line but no flip outs ,0.044
this is one of the reasons why i don t like the idea of gender neutral restrooms being the norm  it sounds nice  but it is still just every day people together in a potentially vulnerable and sensitive place  some dick ead will harass  flash  or watch them  and more   and vice versa  i think it could work more smoothly in some places  but not all  ,0.354

i will change your view even further  no restrooms should be labelled by gender  gender segregation is an antiquated practice from a time when it was believed that seeing a woman s ankle was an immodesty  it is 2018 and we are all adults  there is no reason a man can t handle washing his hands at the same sink as a woman  or vice versa ,-0.021

unisex bathrooms  quite the specialty  having 2 unisex bathrooms in a small store like mcdonalds or subway would be smarter than telling people they have to wait for a specific bathroom  furthermore the specialty items that each gender uses  hygiene disposal stations and urinals  does not affect the other gender for it being there as long as it is used correctly    unisex bathrooms have also gone by the name family bathrooms and gender neutral    but yes  single toilet can be considered unisex  women will just have to throw their tampons pads in the trash which could smell more than putting it in the specialty disposal box    i don t know about the box  cause i am a guy  ,0.312

many of the issues you point out are caused by regulation  the healthcare industry is bloated because it takes a lot of manpower to comply with all the regulation  it is hard to argue that there is unchecked capitalism in education when state governments have a near monopoly in elementary and secondary education  and the federal government is very involved in higher education   more regulation will result in lower quality or higher cost to compensate for the burden of regulatory compliance  often you will end up with lower quality and higher cost   tl dr  what unchecked capitalism ,0.146
i would not be so quick to blame it on regulation  if it is regulation that is to blame  then it is very bad regulation   but healthcare price bloating and the textbook scam are  most logically  caused by people  seeking profit   likely due to underfunding  i think it is the government s fault that it is bad at its job,-0.022
the system is over complicated and allows for end goal to be profit  instead of a healthy and well educated citizens  capitalism is the best for just about anything else but healthcare and education s success should not be based on earnings,-0.354

how can you raise your prices if there are lots of competitors undercutting you  and providing better services   but wait  where are all the competing hospitals  and competing universities  and competing cable providers  in a city  not allowed  or  too expensive to start up   you say   i wonder why ,-0.104
say the government puts a price cap on textbooks  you would get lower textbook prices  sure  but many people who would write a textbook if they could sell it for  100 will not do it if they now have to sell it for  50  fewer textbooks written will mean that overall textbook quality will decline  i am not sure how else you would regulate textbooks  i suppose the government could subsidize them  but it basically already does in the form of student aid  i can make similar arguments for pretty much any regulatory scheme you throw at me  lower quality  higher prices  or both ,-0.25
the government would fix it if people told it to   there are many  many people telling it to   it s an issue of democracy now,-0.333

democracy doesn t work for foreign affairs  and it probably is not the best call for healthcare either  if everyone made their normal irrational decision  every american would spend about 2 3rd of their lifetime healthcare spending in the last months of life  that is irrational  and it is also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment  so nobody wants to spend a dime more  but everyone wants to spend as much as possible right before they or their loved one dies    democracy is the worst way to make something efficient  and in turn to allow better healthcare for more people ,0.083

calling our education system  unchecked capitalism  is laughable  i will agree that it is caused issues in healthcare  capitalism needs a strong bridle when the industry in question sells goods and services with inelastic demands that are necessary for life  however  no one looks at how to make healthcare more affordable  and instead just want to have taxpayers pay for a vastly overpriced system  ,0.0
it is not capitalism  those are the two most regulated  subsidized  unionized  and fiddled with sectors in the economy  they need drastically less oversight  far more competition from actual capitalism  then they would succeed  and even with all that  we provide all the medical innovation for other countries to socialize  developed in the best schools and hospitals in the world  and we pay to defend the world s shipping lanes to deliver them the medical innovations  ,-0.104
can you name a single developed nation with a successful privatized healthcare system ,-0.125
we don t have unchecked capitalism in healthcare and we definitely don t have unchecked capitalism in education  we might have underchecked capitalism  but we have an astonishing amount of regulation in both ,-0.062
we had one for 200 years  in fact  health insurance used to only cover the cost of days of work lost due to injury or illness because the cost of medical care was so negligible  in that time  we developed the best doctors  hospitals  and medical schools in the history of human kind  it got too good  and they were forced to give it all away  and now they cash checks against the pace of innovation  ,-0.229
i am going to assume that by private charter schools you mean for profit charter schools  most charter schools are non profit schools  charter schools generally receive funding in the same way that traditional public schools receive their funding  this is through attendance  so for each student you have enrolled and attending you receive x amount per year  so the tax dollars follow the student ,-0.354
in the case of education  its not so much capitalism  but a shit system where it is considered okay to accrue significant amounts of debt without looking at the value proposition education offers  since loans are so easy to come by   there are two easy solutions   1  fully fund  everyone s  post secondary education  so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable   2   completely  eliminate loans and government bursaries for post secondary education  force schools to compete on cost again  this is a very capitalist solution ,0.062
in capitalism you make choices with your money  poor choices allow stupid things to happen  making a stupid choice doesn t mean the system is bad  the participants are    outside of emergencies  you can shop around for a cheaper doctor    for education  you can go to a community college then transfer  you can get a degree in something that ll land you a job  instead of   insert demographics   studies  allowing you to pay off student loans    there are choices  acting on impulse then decrying the result of your choice is the problem  ,0.244
capitalism is great at providing basic needs   society  doesn t need to do anything  there is no such thing as a guarantee as evidenced by literally every attempt at socializing food ever ,0.109
so you admit you are incapable of naming a single developed nation that currently exists with a successful privatized healthcare system ,0.065
just a note   it is not  unchecked   just  checked  in a way that does not serve the end customer   you have to remember that in medical and educational markets  the customer is treated  as the product  by society at large ,-0.208

you guys might want to broaden your horizons a bit by looking across the atlantic  there is quite a successful model in many european countries when it comes to healthcare  in germany we believe that capitalism needs to be regulated by the state because markets do not solve all problems  it is called social market economy an works quite well since the second work war  we have a healthcare system for everyone and free university education  the funny thing is that the money to start this system came from the us marshal plan after ww2 since america was afraid west germany would turn a communist country if the markets are not somehow regulated  you will find similar systems in switzerland and the scandinavian countries for us europeans it is very difficult to understand how a first world country cannot provide healthcare for all of its citizens ,0.021
charter schools are public schools  there is no private entity that makes money  also  making money is a positive thing  it means you are adding value to others  any one who works is a capitalist that is selling their labor or talents to the highest offer  any one that looks for the lowest price when shopping is a capitalist looking to maximize scarce resources  ,-0.125
you are wrong  for example the success academy gave up their non profit status after the hedge fund money came in and the saw an opportunity to expand rapidly further taking advantage of competing in an largely unfair contest  some of these charter schools are even on the nyse  they have some great ideas but you can t sacrifice entire generations of students for the sake of a few hundred lottery winners,0.0

scientists followed most of the 14  i think  participants in the biggest loser tv show for a couple years and were startled by what they discovered  most of the participants gained back a significant portion of their weight  but they discovered that they were consuming fewer calories and burning more than before  and in most cases had lower calorie consumption than same age  height and gender peers that were not overweight  and struggled to lose the weight they gained back or to keep off what they lost  it was very clear that there is more going on than some type of high end carbon gluttony causing this and that it is not that much of a choice  there is other research that is revealing this ,-0.167
none of what you said indicates your conclusion that it is not a choice though  you merely made it clear that it is a harder choice to make for those who have already been obese  all the more reason to not get there in the first place  ,-0.106
that is kind of an unreasonable position  that is like saying  well hilary climbed everest  so why don t you  when you have had no training etc  yes in both cases it is a choice  but some people have more difficulty to go through  also  as the post points out  some of them make the choice but don t get results ,-0.042
people do not choose between between being fat and being thin  they choose between satisfying their hunger and presenting an pleasing shape or longevity   the obesity problem in the western world is caused partly by dietary choices but also the lack of non fattening satisfying food   my ex girlfriend went to south korea for one semester of student exchange  in 4 months she lost 30 pounds  she gained those back when she got back home  i went to sk for two weeks  lost 4 pounds too  i did not choose to eat healthy  me and my ex did not eat anything remotely diet like over there  what we ate would make a north american diet expert run for the hills  yet we lost weight ,0.104

posing questions for clarification  i assume you feel the same way about drug and alcohol addiction  ,-0.064
obesity is essentially an addiction to food  the obese get a greater dopamine kick from eating than the average person which makes it extremely difficult for them to eat within a healthy range  but here is the real trouble  unlike every other addiction  there is zero possibility of abstinence   the only way to truly end an addiction  imagine a heroin addict who needs to give himself a tiny dose of heroin every day to stay alive  like all addictions  it is partly moral choice  but there is a massive unchosen biological component they can t do a thing about  ,-0.125

here is a similar argument i might make  being poor is a choice   almost  anybody could move to a shit part of town with low rent  walk an hour to work  cut out all entertainment from their lives  and just buy food and toilet paper  and they would save tons of tons of money  why don t they do that  why are there poor people   there are myriads of reasons of why that logic is wrong  and i would bet most of them would apply to losing weight as well  ,0.333

why does society need to change  plenty of people manage to regulate their food caloric intake without buying half the confectionary isle  just because it is on offer   this is an an internal  mentality problem  some developmental  some psychological  probably in rare cases environmental  but never is it uncontrollable  why does a nation need to change to stop people stuffing their faces ,-0.083
when you create a new fat cell  your body keeps it for life  therefore  it makes it even easier to gain weight after losing the weight from before  childhood in my case   so for people like me  who do work hard even just to maintain my weight after losing some  the question is  was it a choice for me as a kid to create all those new fat cells  because i am stuck with them now  they just lay there waiting to be inflated by any calorie i eat and don t burn  it suck s man it is a lot harder than people think  ,-0.021

it is not by choice  the same way people don t choose to become drug addicts  or gambling addicts  etc  there is a psychological  subconscious motivation  we all have our pathologies  and most of us can keep them in check and hidden for the most part  some people can t help but wear them on the outside ,-0.146
become fat  then you will understand  yes  it is somewhat about choice  but it could also be due to medical reason  thyroid and the like   we are used to being discriminated against in all kinds of ways  and trust me when i say that we don t enjoy being fat  i surely hope you hold the same criticism over alcoholics and drug addicts and cigarette smokers ,-0.021
i would like to point out that some people have complicated health issues that contribute to their weight  it is not always something they are conscience of  it is just something that has always been for them  when you add  non weight related  disability or perhaps lack of nutritional education to the mix it only complicates matters further  most obese people are not happy with their illness  you have to try not to generalize a people too broadly  you can t simply look at someone and know their circumstances or really anything about them aside from their size  nor can you know how they raise their children or interact with their family  there are simply too many unknowns to have such a blanket description of the obese  ,-0.283
 i ve met many overweight people who eat great and exercise all the time and are just heavier  people s size and shape are not a direct reflection of their choices    how can you possibly actually think this  where did the weight come from if not from excess eating  are these overweight people you know creating matter out of nothing  it is completely impossible to become overweight without eating more calories than you burn,0.104
i don t think we equate them  one may cause the other  i think an obsessive compulsive desire to overeat comes from the same place as obsessive compulsive use of drugs or alcohol  i don t think there is universal agreement on what constitutes being elevated to the status of addiction  is it merely chemical dependence  what about counselors who treat sex addiction  craving is craving no matter what causes it  if it is not addiction it is still an obsessive compulsive craving  ,-0.089

i realize this is probably a minority s of the cases  but important  i have a friend who was never skinny  but never the sort of fat you describe either  they developed a medical condition and required medication  the medication must be taken with food  350 calories or more  or it gives them a severe upset stomach  the medicine also makes them hungry nearly all the time even after eating a lot  but without it their quality of life would be extremely poor due to their condition    they try to watch their weight  try to exercise  but they can t get back to the pre medicine weight and probably never will  they hate it  but it is the lesser of two evils for them  ,0.146

having a binary means there is literally two options  your gender can t be non binary if gender is binary  what people mean when they say get rid of the binary  is accept that there is more than two options  that you don t have to be only a man or a woman  so it seems like you already agree with the goal  and are just misunderstanding what get rid of the binary means  ,0.065
in what sense to you mean change the system  changing bathroom signs  changing some paperwork  these are relatively easy changes to make for someone s quality of life  on a website it might be altering a drop down   let s also put that 3 4  in perspective  that is 210 280 million people  even if a sample change is costly  it affects roughly a quarter of a billion people ,-0.085
i dont think it helps your argument to falsify the non binary population  its something less than a single percent last i checked ,-0.149
if that is the only goal  of course i agree   but then  why am i hearing claims like changing the medical system  doctor s checklists  ways of living  giving up gender entirely and live in a gender less society   just to accommodate those 3 4  of people  ,-0.125
lots of those are the extremists  how exactly should those things change  according to what you have heard ,-0.312
those are small  reasonable changes  except for bathroom signs   do you want a third sign  and a third bathroom for non binary people  in that case  sure  that would cost in infrastructure  however  however  if you are saying we should remove  male female  bathrooms into just one gender neutral bathroom  that is already implemented in several countries for a long time  i personally disagree with it  or do you mean creating 83 more bathrooms for all genders  that is too much a waste of money    i was mostly talking of how people are advocating to change the medical system  how they can tell doctors what they identify as and doctors don t have the right to ask what their real sex or gender is  there are other systems  but i only recall this one at the moment     ,0.104
i only took a generous estimate because i was unsure  so thanks for the statistics  less than 1  is even smaller  which supports my argument further  did you get this from a reliable source  ,-0.438
 not to mention that sex and gender play a very important role in society  sex  both for medical reasons and roles in society  and gender for a sense of identity  something that is very important   these are actually excellent reasons  in favor  of making a change to include non binary genders  how are medical professionals supposed to treat things specific to non binary people if they have no tools to catalogue or diagnose them  how is society supposed to understand and accept the identity of non binary people if society doesn t even acknowledge that they have a different identity ,0.021
doctors don t need to know your actual sex or gender  only what you identify as  men and women as identities should be removed and society should accept everyone is non binary  bathrooms and trans gendered people issue  it is dangerous and can be so easily misused  several more  ,0.104
your argument seems to essentially be that non binary people don t make up a significant enough percentage of the population to warrant any systemic change to accommodate them  so  what percentage of the population would they need to make up in order for you to feel differently  ,0.0
i think the only one of those there is any kind of broad support for is bathrooms  and even that is only basically we should let trans people use the restroom of the gender they identify with  and adding in a gender neutral restroom  sure other people want all that other stuff but there are people who believe anything  basically no one is suggesting upend everything  and  abolishing the gender binary  certainly doesn t include most of the things you have listed here ,0.085
i would favor a single bathroom irrespective of any gender  may i ask why you oppose that  i don t see the need for the distinction for restroom facilities  binary or otherwise   as for the field of medicine  i am more in line with you on that  particularly when it comes to surgery  the doctor needs information to be able to perform effectively   however  this argument does not exist in a void  many countries has individuals with biases  conscious or unconscious  against the non binary  some level of anonymity can help greatly in these cases  but that anonymity should be case by case and voluntary ,-0.292
your gender identity does not mean you are not male or female  unless you are a hermaphrodite  you are either a male  female  or a certain karyotype such as xxy or xyy  klein felter  supermale  that is why your gender identity is becoming a medical problem  because you refuse to tell the doctor what you are in favor of what you identify as    i specifically said we should accept that they do have a valid identity  i am arguing we should not change how the entire world works for that  so  this point is moot    ,0.213
at least 15 20   like i said  10  of the world is sociopaths  we haven t implemented any systemic changes for them  ,0.149
ah  but letting trans people use the bathrooms of the gender they identify with is wrong   because bathrooms are not gender segregated  they are  sex segregated   and if this is ignored  then it is misused by human filth  i could name 6 incidents off the top of my head in which a male went into the female bathrooms  and stayed there for hours either jacking off or peeping  4 of those involved kids  so  basically   fuck no  you could create a third  gender neutral bathroom for them  but keep bathrooms as they are     sex segregated  not gender segregated   ,0.833
the issue isnt individual preferences  we have a majority rule and most people simply dont want to remove the system we have to comfort an extreme minority  nor should they be challenged to  which is why op brought up the point about sociopaths and why we dont cater to their condition ,0.104
i would argue that doctors are some of the only people who do need to know your actual sex gender and lifestyle choices  diseases can be sex specific and knowing if a person is on hormones or has had any surgeries is critical to care  what if a person who identifies as a woman has testicles  a doctor needs this information  heath care for the trans population is a huge issue right now and it looks like current care is not adequate  i haven t seen specific research on how this relates to non binary  non transitioning  people but i would suspect that the stresses on non binary people could cause or worsen medical issues  changing a medical intake form is hardly changing the world and the quicker a doctor can gather correct and significant information on a patient the more likely the patient receives the best care ,-0.062
i don t know that anyone really advocates for a single blanket destruction of the binary   generally speaking  the practices and actions which are carried out by those who oppose the gender binary are small  gradual steps toward the eventuality  there are 1  people who identify as non binary in american now  but that number may grow   or at the very least those who do identify with the standard  man  or  woman  will feel less constrained to that role    and  as the process is glacial in nature  if we reach a point where the number of non binary stops rising  people continue to be perfectly comfortable in their assigned genders  and those who are non binary already feel respected  then we will know we have gotten to the end of that movement  and the social conventions can just stay there ,0.083
you see you said a male not a trans gender woman  good point those men should be held accountable   men like your example don t need a trans rights policy to go in the bathroom and do what you discussed ,0.271
  i could name 6 incidents off the top of my head in which a male went into the female bathrooms  and stayed there for hours either jacking off or peeping  4 of those involved kids  so  basically   fuck no   how is that relevant to anything here  are you claiming that is what trans people would do if we allow them to use whichever restroom they are comfortable with ,0.511
who is saying we should force laws that abolish gender   all i and most who i know say is we shouldnt force gender roles and expectations on kids based on gender  so  stop telling boys they cant play with dolls  if a boy wants to say with dolls  fine  if he wants to play with toy cars  fine   the point is it should be up to them and we shouldnt force them to do what we want  but few people i have seen in any context are actually calling for the abolition of gender entirely ,0.043
in fact  it would make it easier for them  now they just say  i identify as  and walk in freely instead of before when they needed to sneak in and otherwise they would be stopped  now no one can stop them even if seen  ,0.021

how is a boy playing with dolls gender based  that is a gender based expectation  and it can be wrong  don t mistake the two for one another  just because he plays with dolls doesn t mean he is now a girl  ,-0.064
but gay men and lesbians can currently do those things in their respective bathrooms  so would not it make more sense to have laws against loitering in bathrooms and doing those sorts of things rather than sex based segregation  like  your entire argument seems predicated on the assumption that only heterosexual people exist ,0.292
no it doesnt   what i am saying is very few people  certainly not enough to be significant  think we should abolish gender  what they do think is that the boy can play with whatever he wants without expectations forcing him to only play with  boy  toys,0.042
and  that is what i am saying  we can t live in a gender less society when both gender and sex is important  ,0.17
um anyone who goes into a bathroom and starts peeping or assaulting people surely can be stopped   if your talking about men who are not trans using the womens room where are they   wheres all the news  it is irrational fear  i would think its more an issue with men if they can t stop assulting people and peeping maybe you should do a cmv about that ,0.062
unfortunately  i don t care  if i was talking to a hermaphrodite  i would take their feelings into account and ask if they mind the term  hermaphrodite   but as i can reasonably predict you are not  i can use what term i want  including the scientific one  political correctness will be the downfall of free speech  but that is another argument  ,0.25

   sex  both for medical reasons and roles in society  and gender for a sense of identity  something that is very important   i fail to see how sex is important to roles in society  nor how gender matters at all   i can t debunk these unless you elaborate  and debunking them is crucial to changing your mind i feel ,0.085
could you elaborate on that  let s say this    i could name 6 incidents off the top of my head in which a male went into the female bathrooms  and stayed there for hours either jacking off or peeping  4 of those involved kids   is the problem you want to prevent  to achieve this you want sex segregated bathrooms  because otherwise people could just    say   i identify as a woman  and waltz in anyway   what is stopping those same people from saying   i am a  biological  woman  i am a trans man  and  waltz in anyway  into a sex segregated bathroom  ,0.354
because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned  they are then a male  i feel like that is what you are thinking  a woman who has transitioned completely into a male saying  i am biologically female    which is then wrong  they are still of an xx chromosomal type  but everything else biologically is male  including secondary sexual characteristics and a phallus   in case you mean people in the middle of transitioning  then they should still be going to the bathroom of their original sex  ,0.104
by your logic  should homo sex uals still be classified as mentally ill because our sex is a minority ,0.292
i really like how this post has changed from cmv to   shit on the racist  xenophobic  transphobic  homophobic      cunt   he is a bigot  i am going to put words in his mouth    i think i will stop replying to comments like yours from now  ,0.596
it is a legitimate question  in the 1970s it was considered  abnormal  to be gay and there were people who found it to be an imposition on them to say that gay people are normal as well and to consider it a legitimate possibility someone may have a same sex partner   your response is quite hostile  and you might be frustrated  but i really do not care whether or not you are a  good person   i simply am wondering if this is a particular position held regarding nonbinary people or a general position you have about accommodations made to minority groups in society ,0.312
just so you know trans people     non binary people  non binary people are those who don t identify with either gender and trans people are those who dont identify with their birth sex  and gender if you believe sex and gender are linked  so not sure why you are pushing this bathroom thing since it has nothing to do with your premise about non binary people ,0.042
 in case you mean people in the middle of transitioning  then they should still be going to the bathroom of their original sex   so what is stopping any man from saying  i have a vagina   or  i am in the middle of transitioning from female to male   and waltz into the female bathroom to peep and jerk of fuck,0.396
  because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned  they are then a male   this sentiment supports the concept of your sex gender being based on your external physical attributes  it ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body  and it is there in the brain that people are male or female or somethingelse   there is no  becoming a woman  or  becoming a man   there are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don t feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not   i would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue  because you will draw a lot of false conclusions if you don t understand the nature of how sex gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially culturally  ,0.152
you dont have to engage  you can just say  trans people do not fall into the category of non binary people i am talking  about and then not comment  you are choosing to let yourself get side tracked,0.125

 that is why your gender identity is becoming a medical problem  because you refuse to tell the doctor what you are in favor of what you identify as   i strongly suspect you are arguing against a straw man  as i find it very hard to believe there are a significant number of people who aren t forthcoming to their own doctors about their identity ,-0.021
how is hitting a child ever an appropriate punishment  we don t even use corporeal punishment on prisoners  why should we use it on children  ,0.125
and who can judge the act of spanking is correct or abuse in each case   i mean  parents or teacher should not use spanking because of score on the test  neither on sports  ,-0.087
i feel like my basic view was explained in the initial description  ,-0.292
i am not totally sure what your point is but i will try to address it  of course punishment should not be used because of test scores or sports   but that applies to all punishments  not just spanking  what makes spanking any different ,-0.021
two unrelated points   1  spanking has been studied at length and found to range from ineffective to actually harmful with regards to behavioral development  there is no reason to do it  i can source this if you would like  but cursory research should make it clear   2  a child has no recourse to avoid violence from a physically stronger person they are entirely dependent on  the power imbalance is too great to ever justify violence  unless the parent is intellectally infallible and endlessly just ,-0.104
1  this is what i was addressing   research has failed to separate reasonable discipline from abuse in these instances  and so there hasn t been much research in terms of actually reasonable punishment    2  of course should not be used in situations that are unclear or could have multiple interpretations  ,-0.13
also many of parents forbidden to using phones or playing outside to encourage study more when kids have bad score on the test   forbidden these stuff is relate on studies  spanking isn t    and  i would like to point out that if you teach something in violent way  they also learning violence too   if he she met problem with others  especially lower grade student   he supposedly deal that with violence many people overlook this concern i don t know why  ,0.17
you were handwavey   just let parents choose  except clearly that is not what you actually meant because i 100  guarantee there is punishments you would not support  so why allow spanking  it is not abuse cause you say it is not abuse  ,0.0
i am having trouble understanding your writing  but i am trying here    i don t think that punishment should ever be used because of bad test scores  as i said previously  so i am not sure why you are still arguing that  ,0.0
i think that spanking in an appropriate and reasonable way should be one option that parents have  the only punishments i would not support are those that are abusive  any form discipline can be taken to an abusive level  and spanking is the only punishment that has been categorically written off as abusive because of the small minority of people who take it to an abusive level  ,0.167
sry  my point is  spanking is not relate on guilty in most case  child will never learn from that  they just try to avoid pain in future  my example was very bad i apologize for that   not only that  they resemble their parents behavior on other one ,-0.104
i disagree that that is why it is been written off  i think it is been written off because it is literally hitting a child  plus you have no evidence that more mild forms of spanking produce actually different results from more aggressive forms  you simply believe that is the case ,0.25
a swat over a clothed butt or a hard spank with a rod on a bare ass are both designed to cause discomfort  and causing discomfort to teach the lesson that the behavior is not desired has been proven to be less effective than other means  counter productive and even harmful in some cases  using a known ineffective behavior out of a desire to simply cause discomfort to someone comes from a desire to mete out  punishment  rather than teach a lesson  if your desire is to simply punish your child rather than teach them the lesson of right and wrong or a more acceptable behavior  then that is abusive  the degree of abuse is irrelevant  it is still technically abuse ,0.208
the point of any discipline is that the child wants to avoid it in the future  that is why it is used  ,-0.042
i am saying it hasn t been researched and yet that research has been used to categorically dismiss all spanking  even though the research doesn t say anything about reasonable spanking being bad  ,0.042
all punishment causes discomfort in some way  that is the point of it   so the child changes the behavior  ,-0.021

how would a parent know what works  is the goal to stop the child doing what they are doing in the moment or to create a well adjusted adult  if both  what percentage would you place on those    how do you spank correctly  and how do you measure efficiency    i agree generally that spanking is not always abusive but i have a lot of doubts about how effective it is and how good parents would be at knowing what is effective  ,-0.083
parenting is obviously complicated and a balance between those two things   i can t give you exact numbers on it  all i am saying is that spanking can be part of a balanced and healthy parenting style  ,-0.188
i feel like you need to answer the questions in more detail to create a convincing argument    right now  you are just repeating your point  basically  explain how you know that to be so  ,0.021
the goal is to stop the behavior in the moment to create a safe situation  if the child is doing something that puts them in imminent danger  the sole focus should be on stopping that behavior   beyond that  the focus should be on creating a well adjusted adult    spanking correctly is spanking that is warranted  without a doubt   understood  and after other methods have been exhausted  ,-0.083
ok i get your point  but the point of teaching is  child learns what kinds of actions are better or worse by others  discipline does not help this in the first place   well sometimes the child has been told repeatedly but did not follow the rules  it seems violence is necessary but as much as child gone wrong  parents should be strict themselves  they can call a police if that was a intolerable crime  and it should be   another problem is  its very difficult to identify necessity for spanking in each case  abuser will claim that it was a teaching in court ,0.208
are you arguing that discipline is not necessary at all  children should not be taken to court for misbehavior  that is the point of having parents  ,-0.042
what situation could occur where the child is in imminent danger but could not simply be held  i am finding it hard to visualize that    again  how would a parent know that other methods have been exhausted or that they are spanking  correctly   this lacks a lot of detail  likewise  how does the parent know that they are performing the other methods correctly    edit  also give me an example for when it is warranted without a doubt  ,-0.062

if that discipline is directly encourages better behavior  its necessary  like forbidden to use a phone while its overused or  if child doesn t follow rules repeatedly  discipline is necessary thats what i said in previous post  but if that was spanking  like i said it encourages child to use violence against others    well  its hard to imagine what kinds of crime is tolerable  but if that was apparently intolerable like hurt someone for no reason   they should go to court ,0.021

  i am saying it hasn t been researched and yet that research has been used to categorically dismiss all spanking   if it hasn t been researched  and therefore you have no evidence that  reasonable spanking  is effective  why would you even attempt it  knowing that you are still physically harming your child ,0.277
spanking exists to cut corners on good parenting  not saying that all parents who spank their kids are monsters or even necessarily  bad  parents  but spanking is only a lazy  tool   for lack of a better word  to get around remedying a kid s behavior in the long run  spanking a kid doesn t tell a kid  why  not to engage in a behavior  it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior  which might temporarily fix the problem  but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong  model correct behavior  reward for good behavior  and discipline them properly only if it continues  then that will correct it in their head  obviously this is an oversimplification because parenting is a very complicated process  but studies show that spanking is not beneficial and can actually cause harm ,0.128

the scientific consensus  as you are aware  is that spanking is ineffective and will likely have negative unintended consequences  the onus would be 100  on you to prove that despite the scientific consensus  you are right and its fine or even good to hit children    can you prove that it is ever appropriate  or even just ok  to hit children  if you can t do that  you probably should not be experimenting with hitting your own kids  ,0.167
behavior analysts would have a hard time measuring appropriate spanking criteria  and they are trained to measure behavior in really specific ways  how could a parent possibly measure such criteria accurately ,0.0
the potential negative side effects of  correct  spanking are not worth the risk when there are alternative methods of discipline that don t carry those same risks  and the other methods are more effective at actually training your child s executive function  spanking may quickly modify behavior in the way you want  but that is not an effective long term strategy  ,-0.062

i think he is referring to the cia s disposition matrix  the semi automated list of people who are supposed to be droned if the opportunity presents itself     from what we know  from leaks  etc  the disposition matrix is largely comprised of known members of foreign terrorist organizations  but the tricky thing is that some of said terrorists are u s  citizens  and droning them is technically the u s  government executing one of its own citizens without trial    anwar al awlaki is probably the most well known american killed this way  multiple intelligence agencies believe he was the operational leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula  so you can kinda see why we did what we did  but  the guy was born in new mexico  and thus as an american he had a constitutional right to due process which was not honored in his killing by drone strike ,0.146
i hate doing it cause it is usually a cheap way that people try to win arguments by invalidating others just because they post in certain subs  however  in this case i think it is completely appropriate because it points out the hypocrisy of saying that obama ignored the constitution while the individual posts in a cult sub for a president who has no regard for the constitution  i also like how you ignored me saying that it doesn t invalidate his opinions or him  it makes you defending your fellow t d poster seem more noble doesn t it ,0.167

suppose   for the sake of discussion   that something like alimony was agreed on in a pre nuptual contract  and then funded with a bond  is that something that should be reversed or rendered invalid   this is clearly an extreme example   and possibly a straw man   but  the headline cmv does go with      any   forms of alimony  ,-0.17
 what does this even mean   as i said  i am not too sure  that is why i am discussing alimony  that is  a continuous payment from one party to the other  for other cases  it is very dependent   imagine a person who saved money for ten years to buy a house  the day before the buy  they marry  the buy has been done only through that person s hard work and saving  but as there was a 1day marriage  it is now owned by both  and if that second person decides to leave for no good reason  that person get half a cut  that hardly seems fair   so as i said  the division of property is a tricky case that requires more subtelty  and i don t know   but what about alimony ,-0.021
i am not sure that if it is a thing that is funded until the relationship breakup and is no longer funded after  it really counts as alimony instead of a splitting of the marital property   i have not too many issues with prenups provided that they were always upheld instead of being commonly dismissed by the judges whenever they want  from what i know  a prenup is about as valuable as the paper it is written on   so i would maybe be ok with an alimony that is written in a prenup if the prenups were really something valid  i guess i can award you a  delta for that,-0.208
i could see it in cases where one partner pays for the others college tuition or something with the agreement that the one paying would only pay if they were together  or if  as a couple  they agree one should forego a career to raise their kids and so a finite amount of alimony might be reasonable in both cases  finite being an important factor  alimony or even splitting assets can be dumb in many situations but if you give someone something with the expectation they may only have it while you are a couple  you should be able to recoup your losses somewhat  but within reason ,-0.021

do you have some sense about what the differences between that fantasy scenario and a more typical no fault breakup are that makes one seem like it might be ok  and the other seem unjust ,-0.271
as you mentionned  a couple shares revenues  time and affection  but they share it as a common entity   it means that some decisions might be taken for the benefit of the couple  but might screw one of the parties individually  quick example   man makes 50k per year  woman makes 50k  woman is offered a mega raise at 100k but need to move in the city and for some reason man cannot pursue his old career at all and start back at 10k y  lets say he is a farmer   for the couple it means more money  but one of them is clearly screwed and might need garantees   same goes for housewifes  who knows how many successful business contracts are due to the fact that someone could be 100  dedicated to the job while their wife was taking care of the kids ,-0.125
there are specialists in that  i would defer to their judgment ,-0.447
what are you talking about ,-0.542
can you give a specific example or anecdote of what you are trying to avoid  for me theres a pretty big gray area  what if a partner just stops wanting sex  and there aren t underlying medical problems   what if a partner cheats  that is not technically abusive by many definitions  what if a partner takes a job that requires 80 90hrs per week of work and you never see them  i guess in my perspective  someone who requests a divorce usually had something go pretty wrong in their relationship  this is why we let the legal system hash out all these things  i agree with your premise  but i would find it extremely hard to apply in the real world ,-0.064
yeah  so  if the person who made the choice to take a loss of income make then the unilateral choice to leave for no good reason  why should they get anything  remember that i am not talking of when the person that benefitted decides to leave them ,-0.085
the classic example is the woman who doesn t go to advanced schooling and doesn t build her career in her twenties to care for the couple s home children   the man gained off her sacrifice  and when the relationship is over  that sacrifice put her at a huge disadvantage in the workplace   since her sacrifice was for the benefit of the people of the relationship  should not the people of the relationship pay her back ,0.085
anyone who has even reportedly touched a level of confidentiality in relation to abuse rape  ie mandated reporters from universities  actual councilors  etc   will tell you that the most important thing for someone who has made the first step in reporting abuse is to let them maintain control  if they dont want knowledge of their abuse splayed on the table divorce for whatever reason that is their business  not yours or the judge s or whoever ,-0.146
iirc  affection deprivation is considered abuse  and cheating is a ground for fault divorce  so no problem here   what if a partner takes a job that requires 80 90hrs per week of work and you never see them   then what  you are unhappy that they spend that time making money from which you benefit  so you would like to just go away but still benefit from that money  and force them to keep that workload despite it being also a part of the compromise going with the relationship    how is that fair ,0.0
oh  i got it  the difference between one and the other is that the prenup is something you have the option to take or not take  while alimony is mandated by law  so the difference is basically consent  if you want to sign your money away in case your partner decides to leave you for no good reason  be a fool and be my guest  you can also directly make a donation to that person ,0.109
ok my specific example was an instance where a party needed more emotional support attention than there partner was giving  i was not assuming a greedy motive  but i guess if you want to make my example that then sure  i don t think that we disagree in general  so i am out of this thread lol ,-0.062
how is never seeing them not affection deprivation  they are literally being deprived of affection by never seeing their partner ,0.106
they left for a good reason  just not a  at fault  reason  or they couldn t prove the  at fault  reason in a court room ,-0.208
    so the difference is basically consent     you ve already given me a delta  but i will leave you with this to think about  suppose that a man gets married knowing that he might be liable for alimony later  but there is no formal pre nup  is he still consenting ,0.125
depends if taking that workload is due to the demands of the non working partner  there has been cases where the partner who is not working demands some standard of living  which requires the working partner to work that kind of workload  if it is  i want a house with a pool  buy me a pool   ok  but i will have to work more   just buy me a pool   works to buy the pool   i never see you anymore  why don t you spend more time with me    in that case  where the abuse is can be discussed  sure  it is one case  but all abuse cases are specific,0.062
it might not be  but if they want the court to acknowledge they have legitimate reasons to want to forcibly extract money from someone  then they bloody well should have to demonstrate it  forcible extraction of money from someone is literally theft  to have the courts mandate it  you have to demonstrate to the public that it is warranted  or the public looses faith in its institutions  i am not really fond of guilty unless proven otherwise,-0.128
not really  no  marriage has unique perks  amongst other things regarding rights of access to children or sick and dying partner  that is not for nothing that gay people wanted to be able to marry  to me  marriage should be dispensed with and just replaced by prenups that basically do the same things but you can get modified  you have no option to enter a contract that grants you what you like about marriage ,0.042
that is just not good enough to have court mandated theft slavery demanding someone work against their will while stealing the product of that work,0.043
only if she was the one who was left   loo  at this  someone worked for many year for an employer  that employer made a lot of profit on the basis of that work  and so did that person s colleagues    if she decides spontaneoisly to leave that employer  should not then the people who benefitted from that person s work keep paying that person   i would say no  that perdon decided to leave  it is different if that person gets fired,-0.104
when you marry you become a single legal entity  that is the entire point of marriage  front to back  the intention is that therere is no  one made a sacrifice and now they have to live with that  involved  instead  a single  person  with two bodies and brains divides labors and responsibilities to work together  if that is ended  and it doesn t matter by who  then all gains made by either party are  whenever feasible  shared property  that includes changes in earning potential  especially when one sacrificed to facilitate the other   if you do not like this system  you do not like marriage  period  do not get married  the ideal relationship for you is probably unmarried cohabitation ,-0.167
no one is going to want to be the person who makes that sacrifice if the relationship ending means their life is ruined   who specifically calls it quits first doesn t really matter  does it   imagine a woman  who  under your scenario  realizes the relationship is not working  and  instead of filing for divorce and losing everything the couple has earned  just starts treating the man poorly  ruining every moment they are together until  he  files for divorce   the fact that matters is that the relationship ended  and the two people should share in the things the relationship invested in  and the earning potential of both people is part of that   let s skip the  who quit first  thing  and just focus on fairly dividing up the couples assets ,-0.021
unless in extreme cases  there are no unilateral choice without reason a person is willingfully putting himself in a situation of vulnerability and dependancy out of trust for the other  this trust relationship can easily be altered once one of them has more to lose than the other  the monetary compensation is meant to bring equity in that,-0.312
what is has no bearing on what should be  and that is what i am discussing here ,-0.375
yup  if the person who leaves is the one paying  one person is a position of vulnerability in one front  but of strength on another   the person who earns less to take care of the kids looses on the earning  but win on the relationship and time spent with the kids  the person who start working 60hrs a week looses on the ability to take care of the house and many other meaningful decisions  when people split  there is no  you have to keep taking care of the house of your partner   and there should be no  you have to keep the financial upkeep of your partner    it s a question of incentive  you don t in entivize financially people to leave their relationships for futilities ,0.0

the arduous legal process of going through a divorce is enough of a disincentive   you ve said elsewhere that for cause divorce is still ok   so assume i accuse my spouse of abuse  but i can t prove it  do you force me to stay in a potentially abusive relationship  or do you assume all accusations of abuse are true  thus giving an incentive for people to accuse their spouses of abuse  there is no third option  your system either favors spousal abusers over victims  or it gives an incentive to falsely claim spousal abuse  which is it ,0.021
 iirc  affection deprivation is considered abuse  and cheating is a ground for fault divorce    you are sounding more and more like an incel   ok  so using your example   say i am a workaholic and i stop paying attention to my wife  i am not abusing her  i am just too busy for sex  she wants affection  attention  and time  i refuse to give it to her  because i am working 7 days a week  and when i come home from a 14 hr day i am too tired to participate in family stuf fuck she decides to leave me  am i at fault  is she ,0.396
i kind of just think alimony should go away  it is a product of a time before women were equal in the workforce  there is really no justification for it anymore   child support is an entirely different story  but just going  woman gets alimony  or  they make less money  doesn t justify taking someone else s money   if there was wrong doing and reparations need to be paid that is for a civil court case to decide  not divorce court ,0.064
once again  i am not the abuse expert  go take that with them ,0.188
some other person  trying to convince me that alimony was just  came near to convincing me that all alimony was unjust  while arguing that leaving an exception for wrong doing or for who leaves who would generate many more issues ,-0.083
as it is  indeed  but that doesn t mean that is how it should be  does it ,-0.396
sadly  what has to matter for the justice system is what can be proven  otherwise you open the door to all kind of justice enforced abuses that would be incredibly damaging to society  innocent until proven otherwise has to be an unbreakable principle ,-0.188
no  but the alternative is to allow the woman to not work and then if the marriage ends  she has nothing  so if alimony laws change  i suspect very few women would ever agree to get married and stay home to raise the kids  that would do more to change the nature of marriage and families in america than probably anything else i can think of ,0.0
but you do recognize that your position hinges on the capacity for identification of abuse    without your willingness to recognize how uninformed and untenable your position is because of this significant flaw  you don t appear to be willing to engage in good faith ,0.021
and a right of decision if your partner gets ill and unable  and an automatic beneficiary in cases of deaths  etc  possibly a standard contract that can be edited by both parties before they enter it ,-0.271
 so assume i accuse my spouse of abuse  but i can t prove it  do you force me to stay in a potentially abusive relationship  or do you assume all accusations of abuse are true  thus giving an incentive for people to accuse their spouses of abuse  there is no third option   yes there is  the one i am proposing   you can leave if you want  you are not entitled to the product of the work of the other  you just leave  and take what is yours  but nothing of what will be the others   how hard is it to understand that i still propose that you can divorce anytime you want for whatever reason you want  but that you only get to keep extracting money from the other if you can prove a very good reason to force them to  ,0.271
those are both already possible without marriage,-0.292
yet does that justify another injustice  sure  it will reduce the number of women willing to take that risk  for that specific situation  but stay at home parents aren t already the majority of parents  but there would probably be more men that would become interested again in risking marriage with women that have jobs that they earn less than the man   and right now  we have more a shortage of men interested in marriage than a shortage of women  so that might increase the total number of marriages  after all  that is just giving the highest earner the assurance that they will not get forced to pay for someone who left them even though they did their best ,0.0
most men would not want to always have sex with a condom so it would be useful to know   edit  jeez  i thought it was quite clear i meant that men just prefer not to have to use a condom all the time  not that they think they should never have to use it as some people seem to be suggesting  if you are both clean and she is on birth control i don t see the problem ,0.125

  a fat chick wearing a shirt that says  real women have curves  is still a fat chick   importantly  there will be plenty of people of both genders telling that fat chick that her curves are beautiful and don t ever change etc  she will have far more success with the opposite gender than a similarly unattractive man  the fat chick will identify as a fat chick and be proud of it   the marketing campaigns appeal to those people  the women who get sick of seeing skinny models  they see the  real women have curves  stuff and go   fuck yeah  that is what i am about   they have positive feelings towards that brand and potentially boycott other brands ,0.521

most women want someone taller than they are  average female height in the us is  5 4  with a two inch standard deviation  average male height in the us is 5 10  with a two inch standard deviation  there is not a lot of crossover  there is a small subset of women who want men significantly taller than they are  if they are able to get it  it is because they bring something extra to the table themselves  out of your league   if they can t  they will eventually have to settle   while there is some extra challenge generated by the fact that many tall men date short women  that is not a one way problem  tall chicks are lonely too  even if their desire for a taller partner makes it their own fault ,-0.021

well i don t think that is a good analogy since watching t v is a passive activity  whereas sex work requires a lot of energy and input to be done well  i also don t think it would be at all common for a sex worker to be having sex for 8 hours a day  maybe many hours in a day working  including travelling and promotion  but not 8 hours of sex ,0.188
  1 can i assume you have never watched porn   i have watched porn  watching porn    paying a prostitute     2 how can you possibly know about every man who has payed for sex and be able to summarise that you don t respect them   any of them    wut  i don t know them     3 what do you think of women who pay for sex   even more sad    ,0.489

as a straight guy who used to be a hardcore homophobe just quit caring what people think  if their re closed minded enough to be offended you exist nothing is going to change them    the only thing that bothers me is those who makes their whole identity is being gay    same issue i have with potheads  this goes for straight folk as well  if your entire life is based around what you are humping then you may as well be a dog ,0.292
 straight men what do you think constitutes as a gay man pushing their sex in your face   highly subjective  and whatever makes the person in question uncomfortable  some are already offended if you don t stay in the closet  some are if you are broadcasting your sexual orientation  by  say  making out in public with a guy   some are if you hit on them and some are if you hit on them but don t take no for an answer ,0.458
i have never ever met someone gay who who even came close to pushing his sex in my face ,0.146
when anybody  whether gay or straight  just   aggressively turns the conversation towards sexual topics that serve to highlight  over and over  their sexual preferences practices  like damn  i don t think that anybody here is uncomfortable about you being gay   we are just confused and weirded out that you feel the need to keep piloting the conversation towards sex  by no means limited to gay people  it is just as annoying and cringey when a straight guy girl will not stop saying unnecessarily sexual shit with no appropriate context  like they have got something to prove that nobody else is all that interested in  i guess it is just happened with gay people more than straight people in my experience so that is what came to mind    ,0.333
outside of harassing behavior  most of the time i hear that phrase coming from people who think that any reminder that the other person is not straight is tantamount to  pushing it in their face   those are the people who think that they are already making a big sacrifice by not saying mean things to people who are not straight   a  you stay hidden  i will stay quiet  type of bigotry ,0.083
i have had plenty of friendships with gay dudes and never had a drama with it  some guys i didn t like  because they were not my style of person  but it was not their sex   it was just a clash of personalities  i actually didn t mind being the wing man for a mate of mine  it was just as flattering being hit on by a gay guy as a woman  so what is too much for me  i guess being paraded at gay events as  one we should turn  was a bit much but other than that i am cool with every other experience i have had with gay guys i have been around  ,0.229
top comment pretty much   i have gay friends and gay family  but i have also had gay guys hit on me or ask me out  i would turn them down nicely but it is still a little weird they would ask knowing i am straight   also i had a guy that couldn t take a hint and stopped me on multiple occasions saying graphic stuff and i would imagine other guys have had similar experiences ,0.146

it is a shit thing for someone to do whether or not they are in a relationship  having a friendly chat and someone offers to buy you a drink is not a problem  but purposely manipulating someone to pay for your drinks is just wrong ,0.292

this behaviour is misleading and deceptive in general  but if a girl can get a lot of drinks every night and goes to the same places every time they go out  groups of guys may catch on  this is how girls get spiked  and after that who knows what happens  that would be my biggest worry ,0.229
she is a hoe  plain and simple  ,0.625

bad idea  women are bad at making decisions and then sticking to that decision  threesomes should only be done as a way of breaking up because that is what is likely to happen   and don t givee that shit about the guy not being allowed to look at or touch the other woman  if your wife gets to have another sexual partner then so do you  so if another woman gets into your bed  you better go to town on her     but yeah  you are going to be single in the morning ,0.458

actually  i think this is changing somewhat    my generation  millennial  was the generation that really got hit hard by studio internet porn  hardcore stuff that is unrealistic in every way and shows an unhealthy relationship with sex   but the children growing up now are growing up in an internet with vast amounts of amateur porn  amateur porn is far more realistic and show healthier sex   i hope i am right about this ,0.021
i was already in my teens by the time i was at that point  the first time i saw internet porn was at an adult friends house  he was in a chat room trying to get nudes  so the pic is slowly downloading and when it finally gets to the bottom she had a beer bottle shoved inside her  it was the most hardcore thing i had ever seen and it was barely 15 minutes into my first ever internet session  also the pic was clearly not the girl he was talking to,0.438

for a female to be as strong as a male  she would need to either be larger  or be the same size with high testosterone levels  that is going to be weird and females will not be as physically attractive if they look male from the testosterone levels  growing facial hair and not developing feminine attributes as fully plus it is going to affect their ability to have babies  i don t think it is a good idea   i also don t think a race of tall amazonian women is going to be great either,0.0

well  if you believe the internet is a bastion for the free exchange of ideas  censoring conservative views is a contradiction of freedom   it is inappropriate to hijack the anthem for a political message whether anti or pro racism  ,0.234
 well  if you believe the internet is a bastion for the free exchange of ideas  censoring conservative views is a contradiction of freedom    couldn t you say the same about the country as a whole and that  all  censorship is a contradiction of freedom    ,0.208
the internet  is  a bastion for the free exchange of ideas  that doesn t mean that any site has to allow anything that they don t want  you are free to use the same internet as everyone else to make your own website and post anything that you want  within the bounds of the law  of course ,-0.213

the nfl is a company  the players are employees   some of the employees actions made the company look bad  and therefore  lots of income was lost   any company in the history of business would put an end to it  make your political statements on your own time  not on company time ,0.042
i don t care what the nfl is doing but i do think these things are different  companies like youtube twitter and facebook are an outlet for people to talk while the nfl has nothing to do with politics   the overly common demonization of conservative youtubers gives incentive for upcoming news outlets to be more left leaning regardless of what they actually want to be because it is more fiscally responsible   i believe all companies should have the right i do wish it was more transparent though ,0.104
what constitutes disrespect  and the bigger question is  why is respect mandatory  issues of whether the players are allowed to protest at work aside  why the fuck is the anthem something to be respected  why does the anthem have to be representative of an entire country  why should people be forced to  respect  it  when we can t even agree on things that are disrespectful or not  and why is kneeling seen as disrespectful  when it is traditionally and historically been seen as a sign of respect ,0.521
i think the difference is that a most online companies and websites clearly state that they are interested in open discourse and free speech  and then fail to live up to the standards they set themselves  there is nothing about the nfl that insinuates they have any interest in upholding free speech  they don t want to lose money by pissing off conservative viewers  it doesn t violate any of their principles to discourage players from doing things that piss them off  even beyond any of either corporation s stated aims  i think it makes a lot more sense to expect some level from free speech from twitter than the nfl ,0.125
it is just hypocrisy  it happens on both sides  but a scale and intensity greater with conservatives  they only care about censorship when it challenges their agenda  otherwise they don t care ,0.083

i don t   aside from that the best advice i was ever given was to wash my hands  it is not a long term solution but it helps to remove all that adrenaline and anxiety and calm you down for a while  i believe it is because you are focusing on your hands and not the stress and you are also feeling the water touch your skin  it works for me  also it helps to figure out your triggers so that you can slow the process down  so if you know that thinking about exams is going to send you into an anxiety attack mentally prepare yourself before going into a study session ,-0.208

yup  you have a duty to defend your client  but also a duty not to mislead or lie to the court  you can t question them in testimony if you know they are going to lie  but you can t deny them a right to testify  it gets tricky    once you know your client did it  you defense shifts from proving they are innocent to showing that the prosecution cannot prove they are guilty  there is a difference   source  i am a civil defense attorney in california  but the same rules situations apply and arise    ,-0.062

this is my dad s story  my dad got a black man with a thick accent and he pointed at a black ford with blacked out windows and asked my dad very politely to follow it  my dad follows it to a dark alley  the man gets out then got shot  my dad then drove to a hardware store bought a hammer and threw it at the shooter s head knocking him out  my dad calls the police and my dad asks them for the man s parents address  my dad sent them  10 for a funeral for the man  the shooter turned out to be my dad s school bully ,0.146

not a taxi driver  but one time it was late  i was pretty far from home and i saw my bus driving away  if i missed it i would have to wait for like half an hour in the dark alone so i jumped in a cab and told him to  catch that bus   and drop me off at the stop in front of it  i caught the bus  it was pretty cool ,-0.125

a degree in women s studies means catching animated farts  a friend of mine has a 7 year old that i get to watch sometimes  no knock against him  but he also thinks that not flushing the toilet is the epitome of humor followed closely by repeatedly asking  why   that is what we expect from people that age   apparently redditors are pre pubescent  and being funny means crude attempts at insulting people  it is like tosh 0 reduced ,0.146
the butthurt in this thread will be golden,0.146
  it is barely even humor  all this  lol dae triggered apache helicopter sjw  shit that reddit has just been upvoting madly has to be one of the least funny jokes i have ever seen on this website  and that is without the smugness of it taken into account  just looking at it objectively as humor it is tired  low effort  and boring ,0.583
women s studies is dumb though  stop defedning your degree ,0.438
i have no plans to ever study it but what the fuck do you know about women s studies that is not just mra tia kia copypasta    see   dae feel empowered by their extreme ignorance on the topics they love to talk shit about ,0.646
if we are being honest  that sub is mainly a refuge and safespace for patrons of it to say and write disparaging things about diffrent marginalized groups and hide it behind a thin veil of  it s a joke  as if that negates the abhorrent content  interestingly  i don t see a comparative number of jokes about white straight males with stem degrees being the subject of laughter and ridicule  that is not coincidental  how come  we share one of our mods with that sub ,0.333
i have never been able to figure out why anybody even cares what other people study  if they really believe in the superiority of their stemness  would not someone studying something else just mean less competition anyway ,0.146
most of them probably aren t in stem professionally  they just like neat science facts and want to live in a technocracy  like  have you seen that thing where ndt bemoans that so much of congress consists of lawyers and businessmen instead of scientists and engineers  because lawyers argue and scientists are above that   reddit eats that shit up without a second thought  because  you know  if you are smart enough to pursue higher education in astronomy or whatever you are probably less corruptible and more in tune with the population than those losers who have focused their adult lives on working with people  ,0.458

why do you think it is dumb   honestly  i would like to know your reason  if you don t have one or don t feel like defending your claim  why did you make this comment besides to be cool and contrarian  ,0.271
i suppose i am just pointing out that they are also being part of a circle jerk by being so pc like it accomplishes anything besides tumblr and a few other sites thinking they are cool  ,0.25
i am not him  that said the reason why it is dumb is because it is postmodern  for example anita s    everything is sexist    statement  which leads us to its logical conclusion  it exists solely as an excuse to justify its value      and you have to point it out      it sort of like a digital currency but the latter at the very least adheres to a certain axiom  less bitcoin   more bitcoin  ,0.574
how is  being pc  a circle jerk   it is just being polite and generally thoughtful of others  what he is suggesting is pointing out why they are being dick at igthft by making them the target of the offensive jokes  ,0.417
i am not a women s studies major but i know enough about the field to know that that is not an accurate characterization of most programs or the field of study in general  do you think that pointing out instances of sex based difference in our society and in the way we formulate knowledge is not a worthwhile activity  ,0.104

excited about the new show    i ve not yet watched it  probably will not get to till tomorrow  i don t want to pass too much judgement before watching but i fear that getting two new owners backed by angels vc and my friend  u esportslaw who represent teams might not have the most objective stance   ps   i like all 3 of them  just an observation     ,-0.277
i had that worry as well  but it is somewhat clear early on that the three do represent a spectrum of opinions   noah is almost wholeheartedly for releasing the salaries  probably at least in part because immortals is a new vc backed company  for noah  it is better this than nothing and it seems like nothing is the only alternative   bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries  but is approaching it from a practical experienced look  the salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves   marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed  non contextual  and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information   the balanced opinions actually work pretty well  it is especially interesting seeing how different marty and noah s opinions are ,-0.042
i have the utmost respect for bryce and noah  i know them both very well  i don t know marty too well  but in my brief interactions with him also respect his opinion   i m just advocating that there should be a broader representation of parties  too late for this piece obviously  but it is food for thought in whichever topic duncan looks to tackle next   ,-0.489
yeah next time let s get a   former player  a   law student  and a   pro game caster turned team owner   get to it thorin    ,-0.312
we talk about that issue in depth and it is definitely worth a listen  my stance on this whole topic is that we are better served having the long  sometimes tough conversation than boiling down such an important and complex topic  that being said  if i had to summarize  i would say that publicizing salaries is about giving players more information  teams can and should push back about how that information is used  and vice versa   there is always going to be risk that data can be misused  but i don t think that justifies withholding the information ,-0.25
thanks  i will go back any time i am invited  i really enjoyed my time on the show  good conversation with some really smart people about topics that fascinate me  wish this was all i had to do ,-0.354
thank you so much  this means a lot to me  i sometimes take a beating for my decisions and perspectives  some of which i still think are correct and others that i might do differently if i had the opportunity   but at the end of the day i am just a person trying to do my best to help the industry grow  kind words like this  especially from someone who has been critical of me in the past  helps keep me going ,-0.304
hey  i just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the show and you guys were great in articulating your points  it is honestly astounding that you even have to explain that vc money is not just an endless faucet and that investors actually have to spend their money intelligently   i would have enjoyed seeing what your thoughts were on the chinese scene regarding this though  p,-0.085

when you guys were comparing the esports viewership to surfing  i think that an important  caveat  that might have been left out is that there is probably a substantial portion of esports viewership that is unlikely to purchase products because they just lack any surplus income   i don t know what   of the larger audience that is  but surely it is relevant that esports viewers  demographics have atypical spending compared to the surfing viewers  or extreme sports viewers    so this could be one reason why esports fails to get the type of sponsors that other sports do  don t you think ,-0.188

what makes you say that  asking as a frenchman currently living in france  i am a bit worried for my gbp savings  i m working in both the uk and france  but getting paid in gbps at the moment   but the general sentiment is overall indifference  people around me think the uk will suffer economically from a brexit  but will be fine eventually  and that this could be a chance for the eu ,-0.042

well  federalisation is a big word  but yeah  i would like a more democratic eu  and that means more integration  i also don t want the ttip  so that is one more reason to let the uk go out   but still  i think the eu has a lot to gain from the british culture  political and otherwise  ,-0.104
the sweetest deal being that we get charged billions a year while other countries protect their inefficient industries by blocking trade deals with our historic allies ,-0.146
ah  the old  all trade deals are the same  trope  tell me  what other countries have the same level of trade integration anywhere on earth  less integration  less growth  that is why the negatives to leaving are so dire  even the fta option comes with huge negatives    the eu single market is the economic  holy grail  of trade agreements  nowhere else on earth has such integrated trade  it is essentially moving the eu bloc towards being a single entity as far as trade is concerned  i e  one country  this while still allowing constituent countries to retain their ultimate sovereignty and control over most important policy issues  ,0.109
this cemented it for me today  listening to that bellowing scottish remainer woman last night promising they would reform and fix the eu actually gave me hope  i know they would try and do it too if they were  allowed  but the eu has ironically been more honest about it than the remainers and their empty promises   we are not getting anymore changes from the eu and they have now made that clear  so if you don t like that  then you know what to do tomorrow ,0.104

the eu is not a country  a country would be much more economically efficient than the eu is  as a bloc  since it has no barriers to trade at all  this is why america is so successful for instance  the aim of the eu project is to reduce remove those barriers such that it can operate as one unit and gain the economic benefits while still retaining sovereignty as i said  ,-0.125

because sometimes things that happen in other places can affect us  so sometimes it can be a good idea to have a say in how other places run things   if that was not the case  why bother with countries and governments in the first place  after all  why would i need to have any say in how my next door neighbour does things ,-0.25

you mean like the rest of the world that trades with us  and the rest of the eu   we don t have a say in how us policy is made  or chinese  or any other country  and manage to trade with them just fine  everyone knows the basic principles involved   you conform to the standards of the market you are selling in    i concede that is a valid reason for some to stay in   but not the average person on the street  and if someone was basing their concerns on trade  having a  say  in the regulations would not be the over riding concern ,-0.042
way to misinterpret what was said  he is saying if we vote to leave they will not come back with a better offer ,0.021
a lot of people must be misinterpreting it then  given the number of credible articles that have said it undermines cameron s view  on the eve of the vote  that he would be able to strike better deals for the uk as he would done earlier in the year    they ve very clearly stated   what we got in feb is the limit  period  they will not give us anything else as a special exception  out or in  they didn t even feel what they gave us in feb was fair and  their words  the  maximum concession   ,-0.125

even if i don t like how the eu works  i do see their point   you can t expect everyone to follow the rules yet have one country keep asking for special passes that suit them ,-0.042
exactly  i believe that if we had actually embraced europe and taken an interest in it  we would have very few of the problems in the eu that we have today  as it is   we refuse to actually play by their rules and are always an  outsider   it does however show just how important we are in europe and how much influence we possess in brussels,-0.042

looking to get a good  150  headphone that is over ear and closed  i have a pair of ath ad700x open backed and am looking for a closed back pair   sorry if thats not correct terminology    i m looking for a good pair to use at home as well as take with me to occupy my time on the train or planes    i m looking at the ath msr7 s but i hear complains about lack of bass   sony mdr1a i hear has bass but lacks sound quality compared to the msr7 s    any other recommendations at that price point    edit  i am in japan so i will not have the same exact prices as us  ,-0.5
i am looking to start entering the audiophile market as well  would it be better to try getting higher end headphones  i hear the m50x s are good budget as they are a good price to performance    edit  i should have mentioned i am in japan so not exactly the same prices as what is in america  m50x s are  185 ,-0.125
i am using fostex t50rp mk3 and they sound great  they are entry level planars and are about  159  this specific model is semi open but they dont have terrible leakage at all  ive used at home and at work without any complaints and theres sensitive people around in both places haha  they also make an equally priced closed t40rp mk3 model   edit  for something pricier closer to msr price range  i just recently picked up the audeze sine and they are great for a portable  people seem to enjoy the oppo pm3 too  as well as the nad hp50s   ,-0.417
oof  oppo s are  600 here in japan and nad s are  700    it seems japanese brands have prices  obviously  here where i reside in japan  ,-0.438
the nad viso hp50 is    700   in japan   o o wow    maybe the sennheiser momentum over ears or beyer dt770s  ,-0.312
m50s are good value because they are pretty good at everything  not because they are particularly good at sound quality  i think there are better options at that price point if you are going for pure sound quality    in my opinion the m50s strengths are     decent sound quality     fun  sound signature    excellent build quality   detachable cable   very good for portable use as they fold up ,-0.277
hello everyone  i am in the market for some new bluetooth headsets for when i work out  i would love to see some recommendations  i have bought a few terrible ones lately so im open on price,-0.479
the m50 s are  140 used near me     270 new  ,-0.312
so i have got piston 3s and i am looking to get to the next step   girlfriend has a pair of the mee m6 pro   they are pretty cool  i like the sound especially w foam tips   i m actually kind of looking for cans this time around  but the thing is that i prefer an open back headphone with punch   something that has bass and a very  live   fun sound but not something v shaped to the point where it is tiring to listen to  i prefer open back because of the sound stage  i have tried ath m50x s and they sounded really congested and bad to me    any suggestions for an open back headphone that doesn t rid of the bass or  fun  sound   it s almost as if i am looking for a pair of speakers with a sub for my ears lol,-0.146
  take with me to occupy my time on the train or planes   the msr7 don t isolate that well in loud environments  the 1a would be better from that perspective  comfort  and provides more bass   the oppo pm3 and nad visio hp50 are both good isolators  but i just saw your comment about how overpriced they are  plus the pm3 would not have enough bass if you are worried about bass on the msr7   i ve had a lot of portables and i think the 1a may be best for you  especially considering reasonable japan prices  the momentums are really laid back up top  the the m50x are more v shaped that the 1a  ,-0.191
i mean i am not ass about bass  i listen to rock and metal but i will prioritize crisp good sound  for pc use  over bass  do the mdr1a do well gaming though    edit  i saw on the web the bose true sound ae ii for travel and portability  any word on those  online reviews seem fairly good  some bad ones  ,0.085
  i will prioritize crisp good sound  msr7 would be a good option then  for a closed headphone the msr7 are fine for gaming   generally bose suck s for sound quality  unless active noise cancelling is your number 1 priority  as they do that better than anyone else,-0.229

the m50x does have good noise isolation  but isolation doesn t help that well with low notes like an engine hum  noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they are predictable  i would say it is still enough  i have used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable  having to pop my ears was more annoying   noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic  the two waves cancel each other  think like two ocean waves where the peak of one is at the trough of the other  both being the same distance from 0  if you put then on top of each other  it will add to 0 ,-0.333

both are fine for gaming  the soundstage difference is negligible  i would take the hd600 since it is a better headphone overall  i can t say whether or not the omni can power them since i don t know the omni and they don t exactly post specs  at least not the ones that really matter with headphones ,-0.312

if you like edm and want some isolation from the outside world the dt770 will be a better pick  they are a lot more fun sounding  meaning bass boosted  and are very comfy and durable   the hd558 are not nearly as sturdy and don t isolate but they have a cleaner midrange and less bass  treble  that means they sound more natural for movies  but lack the bass slam you want for edm ,-0.167

hope all goes well for al and the ufc doesn t do their mafia tactics like shelfing him or getting him fuck up matchups and saying they will cut him if he doesn t fight a bad match up on short notice,0.458
boo me  fuck you  get paid al  ,0.646
i think he has a point that he should be paid more because of the reebok deal  but the reality is he has no leverage to negotiate with  i think he should just suck it up and finish out his contract because what exactly would be the alternative  its a shit situation but fighting and at least getting paid seems the better of two bad options ,0.104
i never understand this shit    you know how you don t make more money  by not fighting  iaquinta has been hurt for like 2 years and doesn t appeal at all to a casual audience  by not fighting all you are doing is extending the amount of time you will not get paid for  ,0.583
  according to iaquinta  the ufc allowed him to bow out of the fighter summit but then when he posted photos on a beach near his house a few days later  he received a call asking why he was playing in the sand when he was supposed to be too sick to attend the meeting in las vegas   lol    iaquinta eventually got on a conference call with ufc officials to explain what had happened but the end result was still the same  he was not eligible for any post fight bonuses such as  performance of the night  for his next three bouts in the ufc   huh  didn t know they could do that  interesting ,-0.188
well unfortunately they can do anything  they have all of the power ,-0.271
its his best course of action  judging by the article he is not in the ufc good books as it is and it is not like he has signed a huge fight deal  its will not matter to the ufc if he doesn t fight since lw is stacked as it is  i say go the koscheck way and take short notice fights quickly and fight out the contract  no doubt bellator would be interested in him  ,-0.091

all we know is that al called in sick to sick to avoid the summit but then was at a beach house  was he actually sick  we don t know  we also don t know what took place during the phone call  maybe al blew up and lost his temper prompting the officials to pull him  maybe he was completely reasonable and this is a dick move by the ufc  point being  we don t know  so stay skeptic and don t pick sides on this issue until all the cards are shown,0.34

i think you are overestimating the interest the casual audience has in mma  most of them watch events  see fights and forget about them after the night is over  millions went to bars and went to friends houses to watch 202 or and 196  ask any of them to name some of the undercard fights  besides tate holm  and i am guessing the majority will not be able to name anyone    everyone cheers and goes nuts for a big knockout but it is a temporary high  unless it is like a showtime style kick most people who don t have a deep interest in the sport aren t going to remember shit  ,0.208
maybe it is just me  but something about that guy  i have never really liked him  always came across as an entitled crybaby ,0.149
being inactive puts you in a horrible spot  trying to renegotiate when you already have a fight on your contract is fine  but forcing them to pull you due to compliance issue is a bad measure  diaz brothers get away with it if they perform  same for connor but the second they don t they will be held to those higher standards you now stand,-0.104
so now ianquinta thinks he should get money fights too  ,-0.229
how many retired  real  mma fighters are piss poor with medical problems up the wazoo  pretty much 99  of them  i don t think iaquinta wants to go down that road   if you think al should just shut his mouth and get punched in the face for pennies just for your entertainment  i think maybe you should take his place and fight thiago ,0.146
all i am saying is that is what he signed up for  i know fighters that make  500 to fight and they are good with it  it is not actually just entertainment  it is combat  wwe is entertainment  mma started as a platform to test different styles of unarmed combat  no one got paid well until recently  those that do have proven themselves repeatedly and have thus earned the interest of those that are entertained by it  so they are paid accordingly  no one is interested in a guy that blows smoke because he is scared of getting hurt or losing  if the risk is too great for him  there are many others to fill his shoes  i will fight thiago tomorrow for 50g sign me the fuck up ,0.438

arizona was not bad then  they have just been completely decimated by injuries since  arizona freshman rb jj taylor was an absolute beast before he was lost for the season  not to mention that they lost so many qbs to injury  solomon  dawkins  tate  and werlinger suck s  that they ended up playing a te at qb for part of a game  matt morin   then they lost pretty much everyone who has ever lined up at rb  to the point they started wr samajie grant at rb  you are probably safer playing with your toaster in the shower than behind the line for arizona   anyway  point being  i think if arizona was at full strength  they would not be the pac 12 cellar dweller they are now  jj taylor was scary ,0.021

  in that scenario  it would be incredibly clear you would not deserve to be there   incredibly clear  highly doubtful there would be 4 teams that are  clearly  ahead of an undefeated pac 12 champion  no way the committee puts both michigan and ohio state in ,-0.417
washington is ranked 9th   1a  wisconsin gets the fourth spot ,-0.438
biggest surprise will be the ohio state university will be either 4th ahead of washington or fifth ready to walk right into the play offs if they beat michigan ,-0.298
perhaps clearly is too strong  but i think the one loss michigan scenario with utah imploding would likely go against washington   i think your biggest worry is auburn and a m both winning out with auburn beating bama at the iron bowl  then you have the sec champ as bama and a one loss a m that can claim to have beaten that auburn team  or you have a 1 loss a m as the sec champ and a 1 loss bama with a win over the sec champ  that scenario is your worst case scenario ,-0.354
you think alabama will lose one or two of it is remaining games ,-0.417
not to mention michigan  clemson  louisville  a m or osu,-0.511
i think we may be ranked lower than some expect due to the georgia loss but this does not bother me so much as i realize that we still have three games left to play and any number of things can still go wrong ,-0.298
louisville doesn t get much love because of sos  could potentially see them as low as 6 maybe even lower depending on how cruel they are   first time bama in the top 4 is a no brainer  it would be a shame if  the committee decided to  stir up some controversy  probably not happening  but one can hope    wahington  potentially  gets punished for sos  probably will not matter if they win the pac 12 while undefeated or with one loss  i don t think they will be left out of the top 4  though   strong emphasis on sos could put clemson as high as 1  emphasis on the eye test could put as low as 4  but i doubt we will be lower than 3 ,-0.042

oh yeah  that guy  forgot about him     i think it is kinda hard though because people say  oh  fromsoft have a fire boss  so lazy  but they are kinda hampered by their own lore tied their own noose by having poison   pyromancy linked so strongly so the earthen peak boss is firebat but yeah  hopefully we get some brand new design  even if it is humanoid if it had the look of someone like sir alonne that could be amazing ,-0.042
holy crap  that boss looks like it will fight like an expanded upon flamelurker  that is amazing,-0.229
i don t mind the fire theme as much as that it is kind of a combination of two bosses that were before and nothing new   i guess it shows that it is either kinda stale by now or that they are running out of ideas for this series  ,-0.083

that is true  but 13  is not  that  much  as well as that  their support is steadily declining now  since many of their voters were eurosceptic conservatives who essentially just used them as a protest vote   they re also severely unpopular with the people who don t vote for them   most people say they would not even consider it  last i checked  nigel farage had a favourability rating of something like  53 in the uk ,0.0
i love all these comments snidely saying things like  i asked my serbian friend what he thinks of brexit and he thinks it was dumb    this precisely the attitude that alienated the uk from the eu in the first place  no idea why redditors here think the average brit cares about the opinion of someone judging them comfortably from outside the country ,0.417

well i guess we will see  there is no polling really that i have seen  all i have seen is that this is an ultra conservative district that is showing more dem turnout than they are used to   i suppose it is what came first the chicken or the egg  but when kansas votes in people like brownback it is tough to see it as a state dems should really go after  there seems to be this sentiment after dems losing everything to go too far in the other direction and try to contest everything but that makes little sense  i think we middle ground  maybe kansas fits into that  i am not sure ,-0.149

  uses biology to explain why women are inferior as engineers and leadership positions   i read the thing  or at least i would like to think i did  could you point me to the part where he specifically says that women are inferior   also     did anyone read that part about conservatives being more fit for  mature companies   whatever that means   this part     alienating conservatives is both non inclusive and generally bad business because conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness  he links to an article here   which is required for much of the drudgery and maintenance work characteristic of a mature company   not sure what you are confused about  the  mature company  part  pretty self evident no  ,0.208

can you tell me how this guys isnt saying women are inferior in the following attributes ways  leadership  drive  ideas  more prone to anxiety and neurotics  spend more money  and on and on  some of his quotes among many more   this leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary  asking for raises  speaking up  and   leading       openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than   ideas    women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things  relative to men    women on average look for more work life balance while   men have a higher drive for status   on average    women on average are more prone to anxiety     considering women spend more money than men     women have higher  neuroticism  higher anxiety  lower stress tolerance    ,0.191
as far as i can tell he feels alienated because no one wants to listen to his sexist bull shit   maybe he should right another memo about other conservative viewpoints like trade  economic or foreign policy  until then  i am going to assume people didn t like him because he was an ass hole   not because he was a conservative ,0.604
why does this conversation have to happen at google  they don t want to have the conversation  they do t think it is beneficial to debate about whether or not women are equal to men  this guy can have that conversation on his own time but it sounds like no one wants to hear it and that makes him feel marginalized because his sexist views aren t being given fair time  ,0.021

this is true  in part  but it also seems like the gop has effectively jumped the gun on their end game of a society of brainwashed serfs  and are going to burn themselves out within a decade   the cult of trump is only losing members  while the viewership of fox news continues to die off and progressives continue to rally behind principles and the principled people who embody them   the long game is looking good  we just need to stay alert and active  so we survive the short term cluster fuck,0.396
let s be honest here  trump is largely a cultural backlash to the first black president  there is going to be another backlash to the first openly white nationalist president  the difference was trump s wave was driven by a very vocal minority  the backlash to trump will be driven by the overwhelmingly majority ,0.0
are trumpists really mad though  seems trump is able to maintain a steady 35  or so approval no matter what  it seems like the more he fails as a leader  the more the brainwashed fanatics have his back  ,0.396
trumpists are made at other parts of the republican party ,-0.17
they might never turn against trump  but they certainly can and will turn against gop leadership  specifically in primary battles  and while it might seem like they will always do whatever trump says to us  the data tells a more complicated tale  his strong approvals have been dropping  and that seems to suggest that turnout from his base might fall in the coming years   ,0.083
  it also seems like the gop has effectively jumped the gun on their end game of a society of brainwashed serfs  i was surprised how they immediately began acting like they were a dictatorship as soon as trump got into office  they probably could have successfully removed the democratic process if they had been slow and careful about it  him being so erratic and stupid certainly hurt their ability to  but they have been complicit with his idiocy from day 1  evil s incompetence might be the only thing that saved the republic in the end ,0.292
they are mad at the gop  not at trump  trump voters and trump supporters have a gap  a lot of voters have some disapproval  it is the supporters who are dangerous  ,0.042
true  but i fear their dissatisfaction with the gop belies a more dangerous problem  honestly i take issue with calling them supporters at this point   that word implies that they support him for purely political reasons or that the movement itself is purely political  in reality they are racist fanatics of a cult of personality ,0.229
  the long game is looking good  we just need to stay alert and active  so we survive the short term cluster fuck have control of state legislatures  governor s mansions  the house  senate  white house and supreme court  the long term is not looking good for democrats  it may seem like we are at rock bottom but we don t know that  we could lose in 2018 and see quite a few democratic senators go without picking up too many house seats  if this happens we are in serious trouble  ,0.083
this is what qualifies as the short term cluster fuck we must survive ,0.292
i don t have data on hand  but between their aging target demographic and several articles i have read  that is what i have been led to understand as the state of things  i freely acknowledge that i might be misled  but i don t think that is a huge probability given the diversity of sources over time that have reinforced this interpretation ,-0.021
exactly  they are always going to say they approve because they hate liberals that much  but if they lose their enthusiasm they will not turnout    just like how progressives didn t show up for hillary and democrats down ballot despite the threat of trump ,-0.083
i think the people in the donald are causing the serious fall in his popularity ,-0.229

i remember thinking about how good the long game looked in 2008 and 2012  prior to 2012 i thought that if we could just get another four more years with obama then demographic changes would carry the day in 2016 and by 2020 the republicans would be forced to moderate or start losing elections  the 2012 post mordem of the gop seemed to confirm this    then 2014 happened then trump happened and then we lost big in down ticket races in 2016  maybe i will be a happy drunk in november 2018 but i no longer think that political success is a long term likelihood  there is simply too much variability ,-0.208

if you do not call from trump to meet the business end of a noose  you are a supporter as far as i am concerned ,0.271

the red guard were supporters  as in they literally supported the regime  it is not politics as usual  no  but he still has supporters ,-0.125
i am trying to make a nuanced point here   not sure if i can dumb it down any more  i am trying to say  when you call them supporters  it implies they are supporting him out of normal political reasons  and that if he fails to live up to his promises they will abandon him  i am arguing that we stop calling them  supporters  because that normalizes fanaticism and personality cults  and no  red guards were not merely  mao supporters  unless you are disingenuously applying the very broadest use of the word ,0.167
would not this imply gop popularity was relatively high to begin with  republican party has hovered between 50 to 70 percent unfavorable for the last five years  while democratic party has been between 40 to 50 percent unfavorable  a sudden free fall to 70  gop unfavorable would not be shocking since it would echo recent trends ,-0.021

my portfolio is up almost 25  since he took office  rolling back obama regulations which hurt our economy is a huge help to every american  illegal immigration is way down while deportations are up  i love the way he calls out the media on their bs  he is done a lot of great things and obviously loves america  i am really glad i voted for him ,-0.146
name one piece of major legislation that he signed that made america great,-0.146
  just like how progressives didn t show up for hillary and democrats down ballot despite the threat of trump   i don t think trump was perceived as a threat  really  he was lampooned even as he was hours away from winning the election   i think a lot of people didn t seriously believe so many millions of americans were willing to vote for such a candidate  that so many regret their vote now doesn t change the fact that the party s decades long effort to destroy public education and dismantle the fourth estate with propaganda has been extremely effective ,0.128
 but if they lose their enthusiasm they will not turnout   i thought republicans always turn out no matter what    isn t it dems who always need someone amazing to rally them  ,-0.125
um  sure  and deservedly so  but please don t rest your laurels on people not conceivably voting republican in any given election  you can t outwork crazy  but that is exactly what you need to do every goddamn election  doubly so midterms  ,0.062

a number of people have suggested boot media and a refresh   if the boot media is not handy  or you want to give yourself a bit of an extra challenge  edit your grub prompt to boot to  init  bin bash   this will  rather than starting systemd to bring you your system  start bash  this has the effect of pretty much only requiring a working kernel  but also requires you to bring up anything you need  read write access to your disks  any partitions other than    networking  manually  yoursel fuck ctl c doesn t work  and there are no extra terminals  unless you make them   so don t run anything that might not terminate on its own ,-0.25
it is not bricked  boot any live cd and you should be able to recover  or mount and backup your files before re installing  it is nigh on impossible to brick a pc as others have said    unless you were doing something quite unusual your files should be located in   home  username    perhaps   var w  as well,-0.283

probably already suggested but if you have another computer and a flash drive install linux on the flash drive and boot from that then start recovery  i am not sure on the specifics of your issue but this is pretty fool proof for most broken linux installs  there are even specific utils for doing this  good luck and welcome to the world of linux  ,-0.229

my 2 cents    buy a powerful pc  i7  a lot of ram    install win10 pro  yes i am not jocking  a terrible os but with a powerful type 1 hypervisor    activate hyper v and install whatever linux distro you want   take a snapshot  you will be able to play with your os   brick  whenever you want  and come back to the original version in just few clicks  without ever corrupting the main os or other images   plus  you will avoid every hardware incompatibility headache ,-0.417

well fallen was really inconsistent throughout the year  there were games where he missed every shot  and games where he was wallen  ,-0.128
  fallen has 2 mvps   one which was from blast  sure its still an mvp but it wasnt the biggest tournament   a better rating than k0nfig   ratings tend to get inflated when you are winning alot    in the 3 last tournaments of the year k0nfig was shit   and in the first 4 tournaments fallen was shit  ,0.167
blast had the 7 team of the top 8  and the rating being inflated doesnt mean shit   fallen was a better entry  a better clutcher and more consistent,0.375
there was only top teams at blast  doesn t matter if the format was a little bit weird ,-0.312
i agree but the format really hindered the impact the tournament had  imo ,-0.417
yes blast also only had 1 bo3 in the entire event where they had to face astralis with a standin     the rating being inflated doesnt mean shit    of course it does  fallen has won alot more because he played in a way better team meanwhile k0nfig has played in a team much worse and therefore lost alot more resulting in a lower rating      fallen was a better entry  oh please  k0nfig is much better as a pure entry  fallens opening kill stats are better because he is an awper and awpers usually tends to have a higher opening kill stats       more consistent  its alot easier to be more consistent when you are playing in the 1 team with two top5 players in it compared to k0nfig playing in north while being a very aggressive player ,0.289
 ratings tend to get inflated when you are winning a lot  tell that to taco or even karrigan   fallen had a drop in his quality for a certain period and a beastly dominance for the rest of the year  fallen   konfig any day  ,-0.125
well  is not winning supposedly be what the top players do  they are winning because they are one of the best  i don t see how winning a lot is an issue  as its just a direct effect from their performance and hence their rating ,-0.167
go watch the last peeker s advantage podcast episode  he explained himself pretty well   it s a ranking of individual skill  when you play for the best team your stats are gonna be naturally inflated from just winning  even if you are like the 3rd or 4th best player on the team  and in his opinion fallen didn t have nearly as much impact as he did in 2016 ,-0.298
he is ranking people by  his opinion  while hltv is based off stats and  for me  are better because you can actually measure the impact instead of saying a player is better than b player because i think he had a bigger impact ,0.104
just bringing up taco is absolutely stupid  have you seen what his role in the team is  he literally gets baited by the better players and is used as a utility player  that is still an important role but obviously your stats aren t going to be great in the first place and therefore aren t going to be inflated a lot    same goes for karrigan  he is playing in a team with 4 incredible players  his role is not to get loads of kills or anything  his role is to lead and get his insane superstars into favorable positions    and let s not act like anyone said inflating stats means that a mediocre player has insane ratings all of a sudden  so just throwing 2 names out there who is jobs is not even fragging is just pointless  ,0.255
with that logic niko was not a good player in mouz because he didn t win a lot   winning is about team performance  if your team is not good you will still lose more than you win even if you are one of the most skilled players  you can be an insane player and lose   winning is not an issue but it still means you are very likely to die less  have less ecos where yout chances of fragging are low  get more eco kills etc  having good stats in a game you win  often even very clearly  is going to be a lot easier than when you are losing  ,-0.174
ofc it is  tacos job is to go and figure out where they are and either he gets a kill or he doesn t and gets refragged  he is not being put in situations where he is the one getting refrags or baiting others  and for good reasons   are you saying his role is to frag  or what is his role in your opinion   and what does whatever you said about karrigan even mean  what does the igling itself and in general have to do with stats being inflated or not ,-0.042

i haven t seen it mentioned and the op has been deleted  but how i got good at minesweeper was using the right click and double click buttons on the mouse  once you know where a bomb is  you right click it and it adds a little flag  you can then right click on a number square and if you have flagged the correct number of bombs according to the number  it will open the surrounding squares  ,-0.208

to be fair i think oxford street falls in that area and i know victoria does too  if i had to guess most of the crime would be in those areas and would be pickpocketing and shoplifting  zone 1 london is very safe in terms of violent crime  that is mainly north east and south london  even then most of it is gang related and they tend to only be interested in attacking each other  unless you are being mugged  ,0.191

not necessarily  if this map is showing that there are more crimes where more people live then the map may just be showing migration patterns  doesn t mean an area became more or less safe  risk  and it doesn t really show anything about resource allocation  to get at this you would have to examine where resources were deployed each year  allocation is more about effectiveness and efficiency than it is throwing raw sums at problems and hoping they work  ,-0.062

no they ain t  carrying a knife for no good reason is illegal   as in don t hang around with your mates on the streets when your 16 carrying an offensive weapon   i carry a knife daily for work  accidently left a 20  screwdriver in my pocket once when going to a lol festival thing in london  police check out upon entering  emptied my pockets and found the screw driver and a snap knife  i apologised and said i had just come from work  they let me pick up the knife and screwdriver as i left   also carried a large axe on the tube  no one cared   british police use common sense   when any america city becomes as safe as london then americans can talk shit    untill then shut the fuck up ,0.417
  man  i lived in hackney  and those kids sure loved stabbing each other  every week or two  there would be a new pile of flowers somewhere around my house where some kid got stabbed   perhaps you should re read the comment thread you are replying to  i am clearly not talking about owning a butter knife ,0.354
i am not trying to be rude at all but what is not obvious about it ,-0.042
can you break this down by crime type  let s be honest  selling drugs on the street is not really a crime that anyone cares about and crime involving violence on a person is very different to pickpocketing  thefts of bikes  burglaries vehicles etc would also be good to see separated ,0.0

agree  but think it be hard to get a good picture looking at boroughs as a whole  which this map is split up into  as they can be really changeable within boroughs  i work in a school in a really poor area  almost 50  of pupils eligible for free school dinners  used to work at a school 20 mins down the road that was surrounded by famous actors pop stars  ,-0.396

like thebottomofawhale mentioned  economic state can vary quite a bit within boroughs  however it is worth noting that the low crime boroughs in the south west  richmond  kingston  merton and sutton  are generally quite well off  also the borough just to the left of the dark red one  which appears to have relatively low crime for the area  is kensington and chelsea  one of the wealthiest boroughs in london    the map also doesn t show what kind of crimes are committed  kensington and chelsea gets more theft and burglary due to the extreme wealth  whereas other poorer boroughs will get more violent crime  ,0.125

i heard it is the softest thing ever and start the shooting by adtr are some of my favourites   you could also go a full step down  tuning the 6th string only up to d from drop c  and play some all that remains from the this darkened heart album  that is fun to play around with ,-0.354

you don t have to have money to spoil her  you can spoil her in so many other ways  as others mentioned  learning how to cook a new meal for her is a place to start   maybe after she is had a long day at work or something just prepare a bubble bath for her and offer her a massage or something  or plan a fun date activity  if you guys really do like each other  spending time together and really just being present for her also be a way to spoil her ,-0.417

doesnt sound good to me  if you are happy then why ask others if it is ok ,-0.208
if you like it and you know she means those comments in a loving way and not a demeaning way  that seems fine  just keep it in the back of your mind that there is no reason that a person who likes to be more of a homemaker is a woman  and a successful career person is a man  as long as you recognize that  it seems perfectly fine  it seems like you all are happy   to the spoiling thing  just do things she knows she will love  if she likes a good meal  make that  if she likes to come home to a made bed and clean bathroom  do that  if she loves handmade gifts or cards  do that  compliments work too  there are all sorts of stuff you can do with less money  and it is sweet enough that you want to spoil her in the first place ,-0.271
as others have said if you want to make her feel special too you don t have to spend money  many comments mention cooking her favourite meal from time to time and stuff which is all good but the day to day stuff can be just as important   asking her about her day  having her dinner or her favourite drink or whatever ready for when she gets home from work  that kind of thing    as for the dynamic itself man if it works it works  you do you ,-0.13
as the female primary breadwinner in a hetero marriage that works well  i personally find her comments  as a woman  to be icky  but i am not you  if it is a joking or fetish thing that you two enjoy together   totally fine  but for me  i don t even like playing around the idea that the home maker role is assigned to women   it is a touchy subject for me living in a social context that is still frequently anti feminist and anti men doing things that aren t traditionally masculine  there has to be a better word for that   she is not doing the male thing   she is doing her thing  you are not doing the female thing either  but  as long as no one feels uncomfortable  and she is not making those comments to me  fine   none of my business  and enjoy ,-0.104
if you are cool with it and she is cool with it then it is all good my dude  fuck what anyone says or thinks ,0.271
people don t talk about this much  but people in demanding careers tend to suffer in domestic areas  we do things like eat at restaurants and hire strangers to clean our homes  others see these as luxuries  but sometimes they are necessary to cope   considering that  there is significant value in having somebody who takes care of you  keep that in mind  if you like to cook and keep house  then she can just come home and chill  that is a real luxury  that is how you spoil her ,0.167
she is specifically reinforcing gender roles though  guy makes a home  which makes him the  girl  in the relationship  i am confused ,0.062
  it is a touchy subject for me living in a social context that is still frequently anti feminist and anti men doing things that aren t traditionally masculine  there has to be a better word for that   i mean  the word is  patriarchal   but your wording is more specific and probably less likely to offend people on reddit ,-0.044

i am in a similar situation with my male partner  i don t think it needs to be a gendered thing anymore  having a situation where someone has more time or willingness to do those types of things is a great situation to be in  my partner often says he would make a great  trophy husband  should i ever make it to the top of my career  we balance each other s roles perfectly ,-0.104

just so long as you are happy and she is happy  all is good  if that is the role you are filling  and everything is going well  then you should not worry about it  sure  it is not  normal  by society s traditional standards  but that doesn t really matter  tons of societal standards are meant to be challenged nowadays ,-0.354

best post i have read in a while  enjoy your life dude  nothing matters as long as you are happy,-0.522
well what is weird is subjective  everyone has a different definition of what is normal and what is weird  as long as she is happy and you truly are happy  then what else matters  your own happiness is absolutely much more of a priority than what other people think  when we find partners  we are finding a match   which means you both take on a role in each other s lives that the both of you embrace ,-0.312

amazing dude  i salute to u  i don t feel like playing much honestly  ,-0.511
deflect the shit out of him and get some hits in until hes at 2 3 health then all you deflects will really build up his posture bar  then just keep near and attack once to keep him attacking and ull get the last deflect to finish him off  definitely learn to deflect his jumping slam and the follow up mikiri counter on his charged stab  in the final stage mikiri his diving stab to get easy hits early and use it to fill up his posture for the final blow  then lose your shit when u finally get that final blow  ,0.146
way to go  i finally beat him last night  the coolest thing is that i actually felt myself improving at the game while learning him  which was awesome ,-0.239
omg yes  everytime i pictured genichiro saying  parry this you fuck casual  then proceeded to block it with a  no u ,0.542
damn i didn t realize you could mikiri that charging attack in the last phase  still managed to take him down but that would have been good to know,0.0
that is literally the reason i beat him my first time getting to the third stage  saw him do the thing and the symbol and though  is this a grab or a stab  decided to try the mikiri and it payed off  ,-0.208
i never actually figured out how to do the lightning reversal  i know the note says to do it before you hit the ground after taking lightning damage in the air  but every time he did a lightning attack i either was on the ground  dodging to the side or getting killed  or jumping out of the way  not getting hit  ,-0.271
jump into it and deflect it then press attack ,0.0
you don t need to deflect it  just straight up get hit by hit  it will not hurt you unless you touch the ground  then attack ,-0.167
after fighting soul of cinder for hours my instinct is to dodge like a madman every time i see lightning  i felt like genichiro s phase 3 was the easiest  his attacks are more telegraphed and easier to parry  its just the panic of having limited resources that makes people make mistakes ,-0.208
i just tried my best and whittled his health down 1 attack at a time so i could finally posture break him  on his 3rd phase i spammed firecracker to get free hits in,-0.167
yeah i got him my first time on the third stage as well  was not expecting it at all  no gourds or pellets left just on full health  desperate and frantic but so satisfying  keep falling in love with this game over and over   just wish there was a way to go back and do last boss fights again for practice  fighting genichiro was super fun ,-0.188
is not that the way this game is supposed to be played  ,-0.511
  then lose your shit when u finally get that final blow   the game does a pretty great job of playing in to that feeling  doesn t it  i often say a last   fuck you  to the boss as the brutal death animation plays  bonus points if i had been using the flame sword combo and the death animation plays with my flaming sword impaling the boss ,0.702

feel like he is the ornstein and smough of this game situated in a big city the world is centered around too not sure tho since i havent beat him yet if there is smth like those guys but i feel like once you learn to beat him the game becomes way easier since you got the skills ,-0.021
seriously genichuro is deliberately designed to throw down the gauntlet  beating him is the half way point  its where the world opens up and you get freedom in the order to do levels its where magic opens up  its the story really gets interesting and  you can finally cure dragonrot  the game is difficult  but it becomes much more manageable  its just such a hurdle because its 10 times tougher then everything you have seen before ,-0.021
this would demotivate me because i would be itchin to put another strike on the board   also beat him on my 6th attempt lol ,-0.234

edit to add  took the top spot in my age group on the leader board    went from 9  30 last year to 7  46 past may benchmark  to 6 39 today  that was neat   i joke i carry a weighted vest because i could stand to lose 20 25 lbs and on my frame it looks like 40 extra lbs  but it is funny to end up on leader board for 200m row or sub 7 mile and mentally be like aha  bet you didn t see that cushy lady coming ,-0.167

if you looked at the odds for this game you would think it was 1st vs 18th  not 17th vs 18th   carlton were  1 10 this morning and gc were out to  6  pretty fuck up  i don t know if this is telling of how bad of a position gold coast is in or how much carlton has improved  either way  i found it so strange to see and thought it was worth mentioning ,0.271
late last season  off the back of an upset win against the swans  the suns were brought back down to earth by carlton  with a 35 point loss   late this season  off the back of an upset win against the swans  carlton  to be continued ,-0.229
this smells of danger game ,-0.333
carlton were a team that couldn t beat anyone until 4 weeks ago  and now they have beaten sydney  a team who absolutely pantsed the eagles to kick off the turnaround of their season    it s a weird year  but honestly  outside of the gold coast  it seems like anyone can beat anyone on the right day    the reason gold coast sits outside that group though  imo  is their list  everyone there is either young  or not great    not saying they can t win  but it would be a boilover  still  didn t they go down and beat sydney at the scg from out of absolutely nowhere last year    i m loving carlton s resurgence  but i would love a gc win today ,-0.146
i legit did this with a titans membership this year when the cowboys beat them  i wonder how many gold coast memberships are getting around just from psychotic fans like us,-0.333

very wise decision   you would probably get 35 50 k in dividends per year  either you can reinvent it   travel or go part time at work  either way selling and investing it in market would be great   sell and and wait couple years for recession  market crash  you will get great value of stocks and a higher dividend  enjoy early retirement if that is what your looking for  ,-0.458
if you keep the condo and rent it at  3k month  year   and i am lowballing i think for toronto and a  1 2m condo   you are getting a 3  return on  1 2m already ,-0.229
assuming you mean per month  right   or maybe closer  3400 per month  it still brings the hassle of dealing with tenants coming and going  as someone who has heard some bad stories from coworkers who have rental units i would go with the selling option  since they said they were not interet in moving into it themselves ,-0.188
i am talking out of my ass here  but i would imagine the type of people living in an expensive condo are  in general  easier to be a landlord to    as in  they are probably well off and less likely to not be able to pay  or cause issues etc  then again  when they do cause an issue it costs a hell of a lot more ,0.457
rich people still clog the toilet  leave the stove on  knock over candles  etc  the reason i went with the dividend idea is because it is totally hands off and the op didn t sound like they wanted to be a landlord  need to think about ops preferences  not necessarily what you would do ,0.0
several of my friends in toronto prefer to rent higher end condos instead of buying and let me tell you i would not want to be their landlord lol  these people are used to a standard of living and they don t put up with things they don t like  and they have the free time to complain about it  a lot ,-0.043
why would interest rates matter for my idea  i didn t say to put it in a savings account ,-0.438
as well as the property tax taking a bite out of that  i would say at least 5k yr ,-0.167
but you keep a  1 2m asset ,-0.468
you still keep  1 2m in assets either way  one is in housing and the other is in funds ,-0.562
you don t need millions of dollars to travel the world  chances are if you haven t seen it now  money will not change that  move into the condo so you can spend all your time talking about real estate with every other chump in the city ,0.125
 fuck i am stupid   investing the  1 2m vs rental income   early morning ,0.542
i would sell it and enter semi retirement  working a  fun  part time job,-0.521
i would look into the tax liability  if this is not your primary residence  you might end up paying more in taxes  it could be worthwhile talking to an accountant as you might end up saving a lot of money if you live in the place for a year before selling ,-0.375
in my condo run in the mill 2 bedrooms now go for over 3k  a ph in the spring  probably worth 2 million  went for 6500 a month    if the condo is king east or west they are getting over 4k easily today ,-0.362
bail out  split the profits between us 1 month t bills and canadian treasury bonds  i d go 60 40   you will be set to get back in to whatever asset you like when there is blood in the streets   the sideline is a very quaint and relaxing place ,-0.156
no fuck no  i work in the film industry and deal with rich people  celebrities and actors   no no no  they have raging parties and get entitled more than average person  if they are renting it  they will care less about it because it is not their responsibility  they do not care if they get damage deposits back  that is toilet paper money to them  they are probably more likely to trash a place  even if they pay for the damage  now you have to deal with fixing it  ugh    the sweet spot would be people who are middle income and trying to build a nest egg of their own for buying property  people who actually want damage deposits back when they move out ,0.596
you could delegate to a property manager  have nothing to worry about  collect a decent monthly income and down the road sell it ,-0.417
taxes etc though  and returns are not the same across the board for real estate  even though the average is say 3   plus the real estate diversifies him  i am inclined to agree with your earlier point  even if the details were incomplete  ,-0.312
i would say  get a property manager and forget about it for a while  unless you want to live there  real estate may plateau or drop  but that is also the case for the market  the fact is we are in an everything bubble   if after a period of time it is still a source of stress for you  you can always sell and instead hold it in stocks bonds  but it is nice to have the real estate as a source of diversification  in a sense  the condo is already invested ,-0.146
you literally just hand the condo to a property management company  and they send you a check for it  that is the entire point of them ,-0.208
once you sell it  you can t get it back   take a month or two  or longer   to see if you are sure that you don t want to be a landlord   whichever path you choose  you are likely in no rush to decide  take your time  the opportunity presented to you is huge   if i was in your shoes  i would use equity to buy two additional condos and rent them out  interest on the mortgages on those two properties is tax deductible  and then move into that condo too ,-0.244
i see 1 2 million on puts,-0.583
i will take the condo for 1m,-0.583
imho  keep it  pay someone to manage it for you  keep doing what you were doing  it will provide an income stream  and constantly appreciate ,-0.479
if you don t immediately need the money  my philosophy is to never sell property  you talk about using the money for investments  renting out a condo in toronto is a heck of an investment  you want to travel  imagine the traveling you could do with a passive income of  20 30 month  plus  you keep the value of the condo    understandably you don t care to own property  but run the numbers  this is a real opportunity  good luck with your decision ,-0.319
so you just won  1 million  this is literally what people think about at work on slow days when they want to go home    what do you want to do    personally i would buy a house in a decent town  my area you can get a good house with land for  250k  350k  a place that you own and can always fall back on if things get rough   then figure out what you want to do  travel  invest  retire  etc ,-0.413
honestly in the market today  i don t see that kind of long run appreciation that people saw over the last 20 years   if you don t like property  sell it and put it in other investments  diversified  and safe outlets of your choice ,-0.271
dht as always been like that as far as i am concerned  many people are lazy  that is how it is     tbh i am using mostly  if only  the ffbe sub hence i cannot to compare to other game subs so for me it is the normality  still it always feels a bit frustrating to get downvoted just because you have a different opinion than the mass  event though you heavily explain your point of view and open discussion  it became more and more usual this past year that i am starting to post less frequently ,0.043
i mean yeah lazy  but its faster to use google  literally half of these questions are answered with wiki or builder  as long as i understand that builder is not for everyone  but wiki is just great     yeah  exactly that  thats my only game sub on reddit  and was so fun to visit  comment  ect  now its so bad  im not even trying anymore ,0.083
what is frustrating is that most build questions are answered by  well  go on ffbeequip and put your stuff unit  we cannot say otherwise    the questions are so specific sometimes that it feels people just want to show off their long stmr list and ask what they should farm uoc now  seriously  you are rank 180   you know the game and you know your account ressources far better than us  duh   the  what should i uoc  are so frequent too  i just want to say  well  if you are asking what to uoc  then you probably don t need to use your uoc  if you lack a role  you will not thing twice about what to get  the rest is pure epeen and epeen is a matter of preference    sorry for the rant xd,0.146
i think a large problem might be that people are playing the game on their phone and are therefore also browsing reddit on their phone   i m not sure how it is for others  but for me the wiki is not very phone friendly  neither is reddit  but it is not as bad and you can continue playing the game whilst you wait for some chump to do the hard work for you of finding the answer to your question  sorry tom    i ve pretty much given up on answering questions regularly on the dht  too many questions that don t need to be asked ,-0.083
i mean i like helping people there sometimes  but with actual problems  not this bull shit      and mobile version of wiki is not that bad imo  but thats me     reddit is much worse on phone ,0.354
every time i load a page  switch to game and then back into chrome  the page reloads  which makes the game reload as well ,-0.604
just curious  what kind of examples does this show offs dht questions did you see already    i might have done it before  so that i can adjust too ,-0.062
  i am not sure how it is for others  but for me the wiki is not very phone friendly   i m curious  is this line regarding the default mobile layout for the wiki   which i think is downright horrible     or are you already requesting the desktop version of the wiki on your phone  and  justifiably  still find it unwieldy to navigate due to the frequent zooming and panning required ,-0.188
basically  people who ask who to uoc prism stmr  because they have   insert insane list of ressources  unit  stmr    and were lucky with the anni tickets so  you know  they can spare the extra for fun   it s a legit question  but tbh  you are not really asking the question  because you know the answer  but you want to hear it  again nothing wrong with it  but it just feels tiring and like you just want to rub your luck in everyone s face  and i would rather spend my time to answer legitimate questions ,0.333
my annoyance with this is ffbeequip is blocked at work  which is honestly when i would use it the most  makes it really annoying if i am trying to do some hard trial during my lunch break and can t tell what the hell anyone is using in their event guide  i don t understand how that site is blocked  but reddit and the wiki and other game sites aren t,-0.064
if you need some builds to be performed  don t hesitate to pm me   ,-0.583
yeah i made the mistake of commenting on the  hostile reminder  post and got downvoted for saying light element esthers should be in the nemesis tab  like i get the guy would have got a better response had he not been  hostile  about it  but why downvote all the comments because the op pissed you off  meh ,0.125
it is seriously disgusting to me that the playerbase on the main sub will downvote criticism of gumi  criticism that would result in their best interest as a consumer  these people are absolute degenerate morons  gumi is not your friend  they never will be  they are a multi million dollar company   also the  post your 10 1 pull  threads need to be removed and people who post them should be banned off the sub  it is insanely annoying and just buries legitimate posts that may help better inform someone ,0.042

that is why i only try to post there once a month   for the usual outlooks  main sub s getting more whacked these days ,-0.062
the main sub goes through phases like everything else  and i feel like there have always been easily researched questioned asked on the dht  and players posting  questions  just to show off their rosters  aside from a few too many fan unit contest threads  i am fine with it over there  i prefer hanging out here anyway   as for downvotes  i generally only downvote people being asshats   rude  insulting  ignorant  dismissive  though there are two users i downvote on sight  one is a homophobic shit bag who said something vile on the main a few weeks back and the other is a notorious longtime troll who needs to eff right off  i like them both to know they are not welcome  even if it doesn t do anything ,0.375
every sub has its own problems  there is a lot of whiny folks milling about around here who just need to up and quit if the game really makes them as unhappy as they say  pick your poison   i try not to let it bother me and just sift through it  there is some good unit discussion and the like going on  you just have to look for it ,-0.043

i think because everything is mostly fine in the game  there is a vacuum  the negative folks need to find reasons to be negative  the white knights need to white knight about shit for no reason  people post silly questions on the dht because they want to talk about something   it s why i truly like this sub more  nobody over here seems all that concerned  people can post a low effort rant  or a weird thought  and everybody kinda rolls with it as long as someone is not abusing the freedom to post ,0.188
it would have been whatever the default version is when you visit the site on a phone  i assume it is the mobile version   the site is simply not suitable for a phone in my opinion  not having a dig at the site owners  it is to do with the nature of the content on the site   my phone s screen resolution is lower than my laptop s and the tables don t fit on the screen properly  looking up trial mechanics is a nightmare too because of all the scrolling you have to do   only time i visit the wiki on my phone is if i am on holiday  otherwise i just wait until i get home to visit it on my laptop ,-0.261

i played the game hardcore for the first 6 months or so and then backed away for a few months  i couldn t get back into it because the on banner rate is insanely high and the better stuff can t be pulled if they are not featured in a banner  which meant if you missed the train  which i did  for the character you wanted  then you had to wait several months  which kind of pushed me away little by little ,-0.213

if that was the catholic church s position they would not teach nfp  the church is fine with  encourages  really  sex not for procreation within the confines of marriage  it just takes the stance that contraceptives are too much an attempt to subvert god s plan   i know it is a stupid and arbitrary line  but it is the one they drew ,0.452
waitwaitwait   seriously  as a matter of canonical law the church is fine with  and encourages   non procreational sex as long as its within marriage  what the heck ever happened to genesis 38 9 10   the core philosophy of the church since the medieval period has always been that sex is bad and ideally everyone should be abstinent and that the only acceptable sex is that which is a  within the confines of marriage and b  for the purpose of procreation  every damn sexual regulation in the bible is clearly aimed at preventing non procreative sex  what kind of half assed reasoning are they using to justifying this complete 180 on recreational sex ,0.413
  what the heck ever happened to genesis 38 9 10   that s the justification for not permitting contraceptives  nfp leaves the  potential  for conception  so it passes muster    sex is bad and ideally everyone should be abstinent  that s specifically paul s position  and even he admitted that most people were not going to adhere to that and said it was fine ,0.188
it is not against gods will to have sex with your married partner whenever you want  it is against god s will to try to prevent a possible fertilization when you do have sex  whether through birth control  barrier methods  pulling out  or whatever  having sex when you are naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn t lessen the natural chance of fertilization  and thus  is fine ,0.229

i think the real core issue is  sex without consequences   it is not just about abortion though  as this article states it is also about contraception   how long did it take to get the morning after pill otc  i remember that being a huge deal    i don t generally agree with abortion  and i lean conservative republican  but i understand why it is necessary  i just don t see how you can parade around limited government but also want to use that same government to limit other people s rights whether it is abortion  marijuana  etc ,0.396
it is worth saying that the position of some conservatives   though admittedly probably not officeholders  or even a majority of registered republicans   is that while the decrease in abortions is an unequivocally good thing  government funded birth control is still a bad thing  now  why they hold that position could be for various reasons    but if you put that question aside  it is not inconsistent or illogical to oppose both abortion and government subsidized birth control   even if the utilitarian argument is appealing    while i don t agree with them on this issue  mostly  it is important to note that their position is not illogical or untenable ,0.042
i honestly don t get how so many women are opposed to abortion  don t you realize that abortion will always keep taking place  just that if it is not free it will only be accessible by the rich ,0.083

can you give me an example of sexism against men that is not a direct result of sexist ideas against women  men lose custody battles because raising children is seen as the woman s job  men get harsher prison sentences than women because again women should be home with the kids and women are seen as weaker  men take on riskier jobs because women are seen as too dainty to handle it  men aren t allowed to cry because women are the emotional ones  men can t be rape because they are the  stronger  sex so should be able to fight off the  weaker  sex plus they are supposed to always want sex  toxic masculinity   it just seems to me that any perceived sexism towards men comes directly from the ideas that persist in our society because of sexism towards women ,0.25

i had one a year ago  i don t regret it for many reasons  mainly because of the person the father turned out to be  but it was either be sad but keep going or be sad with a new baby  which made me feel like id turn out to be more sad   if its what you need to do  or even just what you want to do  its your body and your rules  i know i made the right choice  but i still feel the sad  you come to accept it  its okay ,-0.188

i don t think you can deny service based on religious beliefs to be honest  a pharmacist is a master of chemistry and not necessarily qualified to deny anyone medication that may improve their life due to the fact they do not have a complete medical history  this is why this issue has me personally very upset  i agree with the statement that walgreens made  if you can t do your job due to a religious objection to medication they you should not be in this field period  ,-0.188

unpopular opinion here  i think not providing service due to religious beliefs is okay  just as i think not shopping somewhere due to disliking their policy is okay   if we are hoping for a society where everyone feels comfortable in their own skin  this is how it is done  it is okay to disagree in society as long as it is not done in a hateful way  ,0.0

i am probably going to get downvoted to hell because of the subreddit i am in  but i hardly feel like forcing someone into a new different career is the answer     what if that pharmacist became a pharmacist before birth control was created  how is it their fault that the  job requirements  you are placing on them changed since they got their degree    this seems more like a walgreens problem rather than an individual pharmacist problem  they should make sure to have multiple pharmacists  regardless of the individual pharmacist s beliefs  no one should be forced to provide something against their morals ,0.104

what do these people actually want to achieve  ban contraception  get more abortions  ban abortions  get more unwanted children and teenage parents  because going back to everyone having 8 children is a totally great idea  i just don t get their logic  i can understand their ethical issues  but if they take a realistic look  what is their endgoal  they must be aware that people aren t just gonna stop having sex  ,0.312
i think its primarily ethical reasons like you mentioned  joining or being part of a community that reinforces the idea that abortions and contraception is wrong  well of course they are going to argue against it  such ideas go against the norms and ideas of right and wrong for their group   to make an analogy  it would be like trying to create a no pants law  imagine someone came up with the idea of a no pants law  citing sources and statistics that this no pants law can prevent disease and unwanted children  people not wearing pants would make things uncomfortable at the least  so of course there will be some that fight it  in spite of the benefits  imagine the uncomfortableness of this situation multiplied by 10 for the concept of abortions  thats why people fight it   because it goes against their values and makes them uncomfortable,-0.104

  a law that restricts the actions of women from doing actions a man would be allowed to do is unconstitutional   maybe in your country  but the u s  courts have not struck down all laws that differentiate men and women by anatomy  rape laws are another example where some states define rape purely in terms of penetration such that sometimes only people with vaginas can be rape   sometimes only people with penises can commit rape  etc  based on the wording of the law  states are slowly changing them  but none of the old laws that define it on anatomy have been struck down by the courts  afaik ,0.458

you either ask her out or don t  what you don t do is make her some villain who is manipulating you for friendship  or decide she owes you anything more than friendship  if she rejects you you don t have to stay friends with her  but if you  friend dump  her because it is not leading to sex and romance  it kind of indicates that the friendship part was never really a big priority ,0.042
i totally agree with everything you have said  in college  in retrospect  there were a lot of guys who were my friends  years later when i got married and they all disappeared  i figured out that they were not there to be my friends  before that i had no clue    to all you guys out there  being  friends   tell the object of your affection  ask them out  women are not mind readers  the most attractive quality in a person is being attracted to you  many of those guys could have been in a relationship with me back then but seemed interested in only being my friend ,-0.208
it may suprise you  but sexual assault is not the only way to communicate sexual and romantic interest ,0.062
he screwed up from the start  if i want a relationship with someone  i am gonna let them know and see where it goes  if she just wants to be friends and i am crushing hard can t do that  i explain this and move on  not knocking the girl in this scenario  i just don t want to get my heart stomped on every time she is with someone else ,0.021

well to be fair  most of my friends from college  both male and female have  disappeared  or drifted out of my life  and i am pretty sure none of them were waiting for a relationship with me   a lot of friendships are born of proximity and convenience and hopefully a handful become good friends for life ,-0.146
i completely agree  if you don t want to be friends  say so right away  don t act like a friend while waiting for her to suddenly develop romantic feelings  it only leads to resentment and hurt feelings on both sides  she will feel lied to and he will resent the time he put in waiting for something that was never going to happen ,-0.152

autism is still not a good thing  some people may say they are who they are because of it and are thankful for that is fine  but remember that it is a spectrum and can be horrible  i don t think any normal parent would want their child to have autism  so what the anti vaxxer is saying makes sense other than the part about vaccines causing autism  the point i am trying to make is that the person might not be acting like autism is monstrous  but rather that it is often a negative experience for the one with autism   i am not an expert on autism nor do i have it  as far as i know  so please correct me if i am wrong about something   antivaxxers still suck  ,0.167

25 year old now  my parents were anti vax  i always thought i was mostly safe because i made it out of childhood  i had a little lump in my throat reading this  i have never had chicken pox  am i gonna die  lol,0.128

this is one hell of an uno reverse ,-0.271
they may not have been exposed to it enough to catch when they were younger  it is not a built in time bomb  it is a disease you have to be exposed to   and some people don t develope full immunities from vaccines  or the immunity wears off sooner than ideal  which is why you caught chicken pox after being vaccinated and why i have to take the mmr vaccine  immunities aren t binary  it is not that you are immune or you are not  immunities are a spectrum ,-0.042
yeah thatd explain it  i was in 1994  i always wondered why i never got it ,-0.417

my friend s mom is very antivaxx and so is her daughter  my friend   i told her i am vaccinated and she is like  yeah but like don t you have adhd or something  totally unrelated and uncalled for  i actually don t have adhd my therapist told me that i end being so used of walking on eggshells and living under a lot stress that it made me fidgety and be a nervous wreck at all times ,-0.021
you really expect someone to take their time and research to post a scientifically sourced statement in the comment section of reddit  this is not an intellectual subreddit it is just to trash on antivaxxers  everyone with common sense knows anti vax is stupid  if you want to have legitimate debates and talk to people who can back their claims  do yourself a favor and go somewhere else   i m afraid the intellectual well is dry,0.229
i mean  i get all the vaccinations i can  i literally got two more yesterday  and i  do  have adhd  but i would rather have that than get a preventable disease that could fuck  kill me  and harm the people i love ,0.354

there was some controversy around that vaccine for a while several years ago  i know because my parents waited to get me vaccinated for that until i was about 16 or 18  i can t remember which  i would assume  in the hopes of positive reasons  that is why your family might have been against that vaccine ,-0.167
the only controversy is the same as the controversy regarding the hepb vaccine   my child is not having sex  ,-0.022

first off i am  100 vaccinate your kids  but when this came out it was marketed as a vaccine for cancer  not as a vaccine for an std    i do understand that some people think that teens don t have sex so they don t need it    i also get it that if they had of said  hey dumb ass your kids are going to boink like bunnies protect their crotches  they would not have sold as many ,0.396
same here  my mom s logic is only promiscuous people need protection against hpv  so don t be promiscuous and you don t have to worry about it ,0.083
well not completely imo  my parents had legitimate concerns on what was a relatively still new ish drug  they were trying to be responsible parents by waiting until they were sure that the drug was safe  i was just trying to cast a positive light on the reason based on my own experience  none of us really know the parents reasoning except the op s parents and possibly op ,-0.188
a close family member contracted throat cancer from the hp virus and almost died  we were very lucky we didn t lose him  his partner had per cancerous lesions on her cervix which require painful excision  the cancer appeared years after the initial exposure to the virus  parents who object to this vaccine are living in denial that their child will ever have sex  human beings have sex  you did the right thing for yourself  cervical cancer is a horrible disease and it is monstrous to treat  had the vaccine been available when my children were young i would have insisted upon it ,-0.021
because i am obviously going to have a bunch of sex after i get it because i will not get hpv  face with rolling eyes  ,0.333

this is most certainly true  but my reasoning is china might jump at this chance with whatever it can  but it is still only a might   if the usa can turn itself around and get voters out there to actually vote  and start some major economic reforms in the next election  then certainly it will keep it is status    but as it stands now the ball is in chinas court  and it is taking advantage while it can  so for now it is definitely a wait and see  and the next presidential election will be critical,-0.208

it is amazing that with all these problems in the middle east nobody has thought to try bombing these populations  the obvious smart boy solution is just to drop more bombs  it is 2017 and i am a rational person who is paid a moderate amount of attention to global politics and i can literally think of no problems that would arise if we just dropped more bombs  ,0.188
firing more rockets into israel will go as well as it did in 2014 ,0.188
the problem is choosing targets  the people firing the rockets are integrated into the civilian population  so it is difficult to find a target of purely military value where bombing would not be seen as state sanctioned terrorism  ,-0.042
true  and it is a shame we can t do it wwii style and drop flyers alerting civilians of an incoming bombing  they would just go round the civilians up and surround themselves with them  as far as i can tell  outside of boots on the ground there is not much we can do besides status quo ,0.0
yeah it suck s  it doesn t help that israel s government is increasingly hostile towards the strip  it validates the terrorists and rallies the civilians behind them in some instances  there is going to be a breaking point where israel is going to have to put the whole area under military occupation and i can t imagine that being done with human rights in mind  we will see  ,0.292

war crimes   before those that follow me around say anything  the rockets fired from the gaza strip at civilian population centers in israel are war crimes  not shooting them down   i can t believe i have to say that to avoid being purposefully misrepresented ,0.292
if you count killing civilians as a success  which you probably do   yeah  idf won ,0.104
nah  that is hamas  success because it was part of their plan  they were fully expecting civilian deaths when they purposely hid weapons in schools hospitals and launching rockets from heavily populated areas  idf actually  knocked  on the buildings before sending in the real bombs  but hamas didn t give a single fuck about their own people and used them as shields ,0.604
or  you know  people who dont want to lose every single belonging they have because you dropped a bomb on their house ,0.0

  hamas will never stop blowing themselves up until every jew is a burned  smoking corpse  hamas has  by and large  accepted the international consensus for peace  a two state solution based on the 1967 borders  israel refuses this international consensus  israel is the one that doesn t want peace  israel is the one that most regularly breaks the cease fires  israel is almost always the aggressor      we should just nuke the entire area and make it uninhabitable for everyone  neither culture is important or with saving    or you know  we support the 195 nation solution to a settlement  peace is really easy if the us and israel want it  but both seem quite content with constant war  ,0.354

did you read what i wrote  the story is about germany  i live in denmark and we have a problem with objectively false stories being spread as the truth and people getting up in arms about it   you talk about deciding what is real news and that nobody should be able to tell the media what they can publish and what they cannot  of cause you are right  that would be government censorship and nobody wants to do that   but there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish  and punishing publishing what is objectively false information   this is the same as if a news agency writes a false story about you  that would be defamation and that is illegal both here and i believe in the us ,0.106

i hear this argument so much and it never makes sense    being too big is not a problem  you can always divide the country into administrative subregions  if healthcare was administered at state level  the largest system would cover only 40m people  smaller than each of germany  uk  france  italy and spain    and you think each of these systems is completely centralised  i know uk operates the nhs through over 200 clinical commissioning groups  ccgs  that comission the vast majority services at a local level    and considering that some of the biggest health insurers in the us insure tens of millions  united healthcare group insures more than the population of italy   whatever size problems would exist in a universal health care system for tens of millions of people  already fuck exist  in the us system ,0.458
not sure  i see it more as   money spent is your independent variable  the think you can control  life expectancy is the dependent variable  the result you get  the  time  variable here is the year each of these measurements are taken  marked along the line  but to put that on an axis  while it would be useful  is not really the point the graph is trying to show  the point is the  economic efficiency  of public healthcare ,0.0

one thing i think a lot of people in the us seem fearful of is compulsory public health care  which to my understanding is how it works in canada  in most countries i believe there exists a private system alongside the public one  the great advantage  as an end user  in that situation is that the private system competes with a free one  so ends up more affordable and effective  of course this is bad for the private business as they are effectively against a state sponsored pseudo monopoly  but honestly fuck the business if they are against something that provides care for all ,0.229

i think it is because slitting a throat or beheading someone is equally vicious and rising to the level of animalistic  minimizing it or trying not to compare this to something the enemy does is wrong on the surface  no one should be doing this  regardless of what the enemy does    and  most importantly  we are the us  we are better than this  we lead the world by example  or at least  that is what we claim ,0.087
yea  we kill like how good guys kill  not the bad guys   and you all think people who joined the military bought the propaganda ,0.083
because they question the truth of this article not supporting the action,-0.312
i agree with you but that last sentence seems dangerous man there is a lot more going on in media suppression,-0.292
he does  try listening to one of his speeches or visiting his website instead feigning ignorance ,-0.083
we can keep going like this all day  everything you are saying ranges from outright false to truly arguable  if all of this is true  why don t more lefties like yourself join up  and are you fuck kidding about not giving more troops  the surge   you are deluded  obama pulled us out of iraq too early ,0.542
for every action  there is a reaction  this is simple law that is true for physics and also true for humans  if you invade a country  torture it is people and rape men and women and murder their kids and destroy their places of worship  they will not give you back flowers    these war crimes fuel terrorism and they are the biggest contributors to it  this is how isis manage to gather people through media   see the west how they are killing muslims and commiting ugly crimes against muslims  etc  angry and misguided youth will react and joint isis    the fastest way to end terrorism is to stop the ugly war crimes  which should be called by it is name organized terrorism ,0.333
people need to actually read into this instead of reading a headline and automatically assuming this guy is a   psychopath murderer   there is absolutely zero evidence any of this actually happened besides hear say talk  so with this logic  if someone comes up to you and tells you that you murdered someone  you are automatically a murderer even though there is absolutely zero evidence proving that you did it  ever heard of  innocent until proven guilty   i would advise people to actually look into this story before throwing out all these wild accusations ,0.0
been in politics 50 years joe  so it is just now time to fix it  you were vice president for 8 years and it is just now  when you want votes  time to fix the system  hahahhahahahahaa,0.213

i don t want to sympathize with terrorists but let s be honest if that boy who was killed got a brother or father after this why would not they become terrorists  they probably look at american soldiers the way we look at terrorists ,0.146
who is fault would that be then  it is a vicious circle but they are always instigators  who is colonising who  who is invading who  seems a simple answer really   look at the latest circle of violence  white supremacists seem to be often at the starting point,0.062
not american  but i find these posts weird   i feel that the priority issue now is d  trump   biden can potentially draw out trump supporters and democrats will vote for him either way  because who else  trump   if biden wins  usa will have a more left leaning candidate than trump and imo it will be a lot easier to push a green new deal or other left wing politics ,0.208
the fact is that it is too little too late  centrist democrats tend to give small incremental change making things slightly better overtime   better in my worldview  this could be said about a centrist candidate on either side ,-0.354
i see that same type of posts comments being made against sanders   it s almost like there is an organized campaign to sow discord amongst the left  again ,-0.146
lol common sense  yeah fuck universal healthcare  and let s help bloody dictatorships around the world   hillary was a joke and there is a reason she lost ,0.596
quoting a russian diplomat on american politics  hm ,-0.065
or  or  we could go with nuclear power,-0.042
can t wait to see what happens if biden gets the nom  will dems vote for him because he is not trump  vote trump because bernie didn t get it  or will they not vote vote 3rd party  throwing their vote away so neither gets it,0.0
centrist does not mean  neutral   it just means between left and right    i consider myself a political pragmatist  and is therefor almost by default a centrist  there is certain politics on the left and on the right that i agree with  and i agree with them because they work      i certainly see climate change as the biggest challenge of our generation  why am i as centrist singled out as not part of the sollution   ,-0.267
when are people going to learn this climate change shit is bull shit and just a tax grab  fuck the climate our economy matter more than a few trees and birds,0.792
since when did world politics become american politics ,-0.375

it does if she credibly claims that he did  i am sure every rapist in the world who has  met a lot of people  would be touched by your support ,0.104
right  cause warren buffett  michael bloomberg and other real billionaires are constantly accused of sexual assault  this is pathetic apologism for a known philanderer  creep and liar ,0.354
  like his fat  fake hair  pouting  wrinkly ass is some kinda prize    you re forgetting that he is very rich and also the current president  women will throw themselves at him for either one of those reasons,0.562
i think you missed the point of my comment  which was to point out that insults get you nowhere ,-0.292
this is grandma on facebook tier cringe,-0.104
she never called for help  screamed  anything in a dressing room in a big store   she invited donald into the dressing room  if even that    this one is even more stupid than kids wrestling on a bed ,0.417
has trump ever done anything you didn t agree with ,-0.188
certainly  hillary should be in prison right now   illegal aliens should be removed  syria should have never had american military in there ,0.191
this is why some celebrities shy away from taking pictures with women or keep their hands visible when they do because they take so many pictures with women they don t personally know or will never see again my use that picture to prove they did meet so the false accusation can seem possible ,-0.043
this aged well  didn t it    you actually believed the words of the woman who said  rape is sex    round of applause for the gullible ones who destroy the dialogue  day after day   this is why everyone hates r worldpolitics,0.34
the op is implying that only a con artist can go from being a bartender to a congresswoman  and  on that note  only a con artist can go from being a reality tv show host to becoming president ,0.042
don t worry op is deranged with tds  op sits in mom s basement all day and trys to be cute  op fails every time   pretty sure op is jobless and has never kissed a girl   guessing he is a 2 piece and a biscuit shy of 350 lbs along with a huge neckbeard   right op  he will not reply  too busy playing d   d with his imaginary friends ,0.426

i couldn t care less how many degrees she has  those are overshadowed by the fake border photo shoot  the  world is going to end in 12 years   the  climate change is our wwii   the 25 0 jobs she took away from new york when she denied amazon  and of course the  green new deal ,0.188
this sub is gone now  it is ducking r politics all over again ,-0.229
aoc getting elected says more about the lack of educated or qualified candidates the dims have and they are willingness to throw shit at the wall to see what sticks ,0.578
nothing says world politics like a good ole straw man  so this sub is just another propaganda sub ,0.021
i just saw this sub on the popular thread and had the same thoughts  it is sad we can t have genuinely neutral political platforms anymore ,-0.083
you are an idiot   none of what you said is factual  shut the fuck up you ignorant degenerate ,0.771
then correct the description   this oppression is caused by the capitalists that infiltrated the government and the communist party    this description seems to blame communists  which is a lie,0.25
what  this is a weird flex,-0.404
 flex   it is a  flex  to acknowledge the blame is with corrupt capitalism in government  and that  communists  have absolutely nothing to do with it ,-0.062

what a fuck stupid comment ,0.792
my grammar is shit true  but you saw how tiananmen square went unarmed protest realy never change anything ,0.271

what is considered a mass shooting ,-0.217
and how many of those are gang related ,-0.25
what difference does that make  they used guns and it was a mass shooting  if they didn t have access to the gun  it would not have been a mass shooting ,0.146
and that is good  my case is too that you need a permit  it is ridiculous if anyone can own a gun  not everyone can drive a car ,-0.25
at least in minnesota you need a permit to purchase a handgun or a semi auto rifle  shotguns and single action rifles can be purchased without one but you still have to pass a background check,-0.083
a training course to stop shootings   so  now we will have highly trained school shooters   great fuck logic dude ,0.833
i hope you all manage to elect a bunch of folks that will pass meaningful changes via legislation  can t say that those of us around the world hold out much hope for you all though  genuinely sad  and equally bizarre ,-0.354

you can keep arguing for an actual terrorist organization that only promotes firearm ownership for profits  only a fool would believe that they proudly defend the 2nd amendment with nothing else to gain  the nra is a terrorist group and so is the republican party ,0.319

what nonsense  some alleged business owners post praising a guy who refuses to tell businesses owner what their tax liability would be for a disaster of a  plan   he never gives tax rate to pay for his idea  not plan  plans have concrete details not  we will figure that out  rates  his idea would shutter and bk countless hospitals  doctors and medical services paid at the discounted medicare rate  he refuses to address this fact because he has no clue ,0.5
listen i would gladly pay more in taxes if it meant not having the slightest medical emergency possibly ruin my life financially speaking  or when i become older i will not have to skip taking pills because i can t afford them    also my student loans make it so i might be able to leave my parents house when i am 28  i am 22 and it feels like i am going to start my independent life when i am almost 30 and that is incredibly depressing  i feel like i am wasting my youth away because i have to work off student loans for a college i was forced to go to  i know bernie sanders would not be able to solve my problems in only 4 years but damn i really want hope for change,-0.125
so youtube comments qualify as world politics nowadays ,-0.292
it has always been this way  with the advent of the internet and outlets like youtube there is no excuse for not understanding a candidates position on issues  it is good to see more people are realizing this and calling it out ,-0.125
no  it is not  verifying employment ability status is legal  and required by law  in the us   the law assesses a fine if you employ some who may not legally work in the country  the reality is that a lot of times the employer is given a warning and the fine is waved  those employed tend to feel the full force of law while those who employ other walk away ,-0.043
a question about why there are jews in us office  about trump and nazism  a question that no one asked for    go shout at the traffic pal ,0.292
hillary or something bigger screwed with his first round so what makes you think this will be any different    if we go down the path of what socialism is  we are done  trump gets shit on the way he conveys but look at the policies and laws that he is simply enabling that assists this country from going down  mass migration globalism is not the answer for long term stability  you can t manage hate  you make laws and build protection against hate  ie  fences around the elementary school playground  a small group of people in control of earth is not the answer   this sign is representative of brainwashing ms media hate of trump that is purchased by a much deeper evil that most of the world buries its head in the sand from ,0.417
stay off the sauce  really  you are just talking gibberish  he is a racist fuck and that is is obvious and out in plain sight both in his speech and his action  who he has in his cabinet is no defense for his actions or what he is said  it is utterly irrelevant    x200b   but i can see you are a simple man and of weak constitution  so i would rather you just lay off the sauce ,0.354
the problem is that you are making a blanket statement of jews  jews do not all think one way  i know because i live in a ginormous jewish community ,0.062

how is this flared as us politics,-0.292
people in hong kong must decide if they are going to continue with it  if they are they start protecting each other  that means living the  peaceful protest  as soon as the police military or anyone start violence against the peaceful protesters   if not  better start saving for moving to another country as soon as possible or face the  reeducation camps   if you get that far    x200b   the world governments will talk  criticize  say they will apply economic sanctions but they will do nothing to stop another massacre simply because they have nothing to gain from it  china controls the economy  producing almost everything in chinese soil   as for  the well meaning foreigners   most of them will change their tune if the iphone prices start rising ,0.333
