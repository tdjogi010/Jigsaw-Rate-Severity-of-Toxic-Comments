So I asked him for citations where they were needed, and here merely weasled out of it by deleting the {fact} text, without showing the citations. He says half the land in Australia is Crown land and it is mainly used as airports and utilities. What nonsense, half the land in Australia is used for airports? How can you allow such spench to remain in Wikipedia? Now look what you do. He was not only asking me for citations in Dog where they are not needed, he was erasing whole 3-paragraph text that I had spent hours creating. Then YOU came back and erased them again, which I believe is also vandalism,and quite insulting. Nobody told me WHY I needed citations, neither you nor EGordon are even qualified to ask me for citations since you are not veterinarians. You and he are guilty of vandalising another writers perfectly sound writings, and you should both be banned of your editorial priv's. I am going to go over your heads and have both of you removed now. How DARE you block me? How DARE YOU?

Of course not, your probably British and will do anything to put down the Aussies, even if it means tampering with our history.\\nDon't tell me to read a book on that battle, I know more about it than you do obviously. The Battle for Australia is not historiographcal, ask any veteran about what they thought during the KOKODA CAMPAIGN, and they believed they were \"\"fighting to save Australia\"\".

       "10   You are the one who is trolling \\n\\nI was not trolling. I went to see the user page of this person who kept vandalising my writings in Dog to see what his writings were. His user name is EGordon. It turns out, his writings are generally incorrect and far more in need of citations than mine. So I asked him for citations where they were needed, and here merely weasled out of it by deleting the {fact} text, without showing the citations. He says half the land in Australia is Crown land and it is mainly used as airports and utilities. What nonsense, half the land in Australia is used for airports? How can you allow such spench to remain in Wikipedia? Now look what you do. He was not only asking me for citations in Dog where they are not needed, he was erasing whole 3-paragraph text that I had spent hours creating. Then YOU came back and erased them again, which I believe is also vandalism,and quite insulting. Nobody told me WHY I needed citations, neither you nor EGordon are even qualified to ask me for citations since you are not veterinarians. You and he are guilty of vandalising another writers perfectly sound writings, and you should both be banned of your editorial priv's. I am going to go over your heads and have both of you removed now. How DARE you block me? How DARE YOU? This is utterly absurd.\\n\\nIf anybody is guilty of trolling it is you, why are you here on my page? At least EGordon stopped stalking me, but you haven't. What do you do, wake up in the morning, turn on your computer, and go right to my user page to check up on me. You are not qualified to edit my writings.    \n",

They will see this as a success in their WP:BATTLE and proof that if they report everything that can possibly be construed as a violation to AN/I and AE, some shit will eventually stick. I think you mentioned something about gaming the system? Indeed.      \n",

This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.

It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been \"\"molested\"\" when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.\\n\\nWikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.\\n\\nGood luck with your Oprah-esque fluff piece on the attention-seeking camwhore.  \\n\\n\"  \n",

       "27  \"::Witkacy, it would be better if you refrained from saying \"\"all\"\", \"\"every\"\" or \"\"most\"\" in connection to statements about personal characteristics.  This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.    \\n\\n\"  \n",

       "      <td>You are the one who is trolling \\n\\nI was not trolling. I went to see the user page of this person who kept vandalising my writings in Dog to see what his writings were. His user name is EGordon. It turns out, his writings are generally incorrect and far more in need of citations than mine. So I asked him for citations where they were needed, and here merely weasled out of it by deleting the {fact} text, without showing the citations. He says half the land in Australia is Crown land and it is mainly used as airports and utilities. What nonsense, half the land in Australia is used for airports? How can you allow such spench to remain in Wikipedia? Now look what you do. He was not only asking me for citations in Dog where they are not needed, he was erasing whole 3-paragraph text that I had spent hours creating. Then YOU came back and erased them again, which I believe is also vandalism,and quite insulting. Nobody told me WHY I needed citations, neither you nor EGordon are even qualified to ask me for citations since you are not veterinarians. You and he are guilty of vandalising another writers perfectly sound writings, and you should both be banned of your editorial priv's. I am going to go over your heads and have both of you removed now. How DARE you block me? How DARE YOU? This is utterly absurd.\\n\\nIf anybody is guilty of trolling it is you, why are you here on my page? At least EGordon stopped stalking me, but you haven't. What do you do, wake up in the morning, turn on your computer, and go right to my user page to check up on me. You are not qualified to edit my writings.</td>\n",

Of course not, your probably British and will do anything to put down the Aussies, even if it means tampering with our history.\\nDon't tell me to read a book on that battle, I know more about it than you do obviously. The Battle for Australia is not historiographcal, ask any veteran about what they thought during the KOKODA CAMPAIGN, and they believed they were \"\"fighting to save Australia\"\".

       "10   You are the one who is trolling \\n\\nI was not trolling. I went to see the user page of this person who kept vandalising my writings in Dog to see what his writings were. His user name is EGordon. It turns out, his writings are generally incorrect and far more in need of citations than mine. So I asked him for citations where they were needed, and here merely weasled out of it by deleting the {fact} text, without showing the citations. He says half the land in Australia is Crown land and it is mainly used as airports and utilities. What nonsense, half the land in Australia is used for airports? How can you allow such spench to remain in Wikipedia? Now look what you do. He was not only asking me for citations in Dog where they are not needed, he was erasing whole 3-paragraph text that I had spent hours creating. Then YOU came back and erased them again, which I believe is also vandalism,and quite insulting. Nobody told me WHY I needed citations, neither you nor EGordon are even qualified to ask me for citations since you are not veterinarians. You and he are guilty of vandalising another writers perfectly sound writings, and you should both be banned of your editorial priv's. I am going to go over your heads and have both of you removed now. How DARE you block me? How DARE YOU?

What you are doing here is sending a message to Factomancer and users like Factomancer that will only perpetuate this petty series of events that has developed over the last few weeks. They will see this as a success in their WP:BATTLE and proof that if they report everything that can possibly be construed as a violation to AN/I and AE, some shit will eventually stick.

This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.    \\n\\n\"</td>\n",

My comments on the Sarah Palin edit summary probably went over the line and deserved either a warning or 1 day block because of the article probation, and I should not have reacted the way I did to the other users instigation.  But again I note that I did not notice you posting a similar warning to the user who said in his edit summary towards me \"\"then stop posting biased crap\"\" . \\nYour entitled to do whatever the fuck you want on wikipedia Coffee because you have the powers which are very hard to take away, but really learn how to read what you link to.  Lookup what the definition of harassment, I didn't threaten or try to intimidate you.  I might have insulted you and your fragile sensibilities, but I certainly did not harass you.  I stick by what I said though, please fuck off my talk page after this situation is done.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Bits andPieces \"   \n",

It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been \"\"molested\"\" when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.\\n\\nWikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.\\n\\nGood luck with your Oprah-esque fluff piece on the attention-seeking camwhore.  \\n\\n\"  \n",

       "27  \"::Witkacy, it would be better if you refrained from saying \"\"all\"\", \"\"every\"\" or \"\"most\"\" in connection to statements about personal characteristics.  This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.    \\n\\n\"  \n",
